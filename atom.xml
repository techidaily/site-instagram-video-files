If you have not created a highlight yet, you will need to create your first highlight from a story for you to see anything on your profile. After the first highlight has been made, you can create additional highlights and name them accordingly simply by clicking the new button.</p><p>If a highlight does not show up on your profile, check that you have a unique name for the highlight and that you have followed all of the steps needed to create the graphic, naming, and story selections properly. Remember it is best not to have too many highlights on your profile as this could cause confusion for the visitor.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/instagram-highlight-profile.jpg"                      alt="  Instagram Highlight Profile"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2115928/19272" target="_top" id="2115928">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2115928" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="160" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2115928/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-to-Use-Highlights-and-Story-Links-to-Increase-Conversions-3"><a href="#How-to-Use-Highlights-and-Story-Links-to-Increase-Conversions-3" class="headerlink" title="How to Use Highlights and Story Links to Increase Conversions?"></a>How to Use Highlights and Story Links to Increase Conversions?</h2><p>Generally, stories disappear after 24 hours if they are just posted to your profile. The ability to create highlights puts the stories into the profile until the highlight is deleted using the methods previously mentioned. If you happen to forget to add a story to your highlights within 24 hours, you can still access the story in your archives. Instagram automatically archives stories, meaning that the content you wish to save for a later date can be kept in the archive until you wish to put that material into a highlight.</p><p>Highlights ensure that visitors to your Instagram do not have to scroll through the content of your profile to find information concerning your brand. Additionally, by creating content-saturated Highlights, you set the tone for the viewer.</p><p>Businesses should understand how to create a highlight on Instagram as the potential for conversions is substantial when using them. Primarily, the highlight feature allows a business or a brand to re-introduce a story as new content with new promotional links. This means that stories which in the past showed a high user interaction can be reused and increase SERPs for that content for your brand. Use the methods on how to create highlights on Instagram from archives or how to make highlights on Instagram to showcase your stories.</p><p>Although the highlights are essential to brand building and conversions, they should be coupled with the Swipe-up feature, tap-to-view link features, and the content therein. Brands that have annual or semi-annual events should merge bits from prior stories with new content.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>Instagram has over 200 million daily views making it the perfect platform for visual branding and sharing content. Categorizing your stories and content in a concise method is fundamental to establishing a high level of conversions. Highlights which appear on your profile under your bio are the best way in which to share stories and otherwise archived content with your viewers.</p><p>By following these simple methods of how to make a highlight on Instagram, whether you wish to do so for professional purposes or just to organize your stories on your personal account, you will find more interaction and more content-driven reactions to your profile.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shannon-cox.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Shanoon Cox</p><p>Shanoon Cox is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Shanoon Cox</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://instagram-video-files.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-capture-and-convert-your-instagram-feeds-top-15-free-exporters-for-windows-and-macos-users/"><u>[New] In 2024, Capture and Convert Your Instagram Feeds Top 15 Free Exporters For Windows & macOS Users</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-files.techidaily.com/new-popularize-with-pizzazz-infuse-instagram-reels-with-tiktok-energy-for-2024/"><u>[New] Popularize with Pizzazz Infuse Instagram Reels With TikTok Energy for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://remote-screen-capture.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-audiograbbers-free-toolkit-and-evaluation/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved AudioGrabbers Free Toolkit & Evaluation</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-files.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-maximizing-visibility-how-to-upload-videos-to-instagram-desktop/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Maximizing Visibility How to Upload Videos to Instagram Desktop</u></a></li><li><a href="https://phone-solutions.techidaily.com/fix-cannot-paste-the-data-error-in-microsoft-excel-2007-by-stellar-guide/"><u>Fix Cannot Paste the Data Error in Microsoft Excel 2007</u></a></li><li><a href="https://technical-tips.techidaily.com/how-to-revive-a-black-screen-on-your-roku-smart-tv/"><u>How to Revive a Black Screen on Your Roku Smart TV</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-location.techidaily.com/in-2024-10-free-location-spoofers-to-fake-gps-location-on-your-oppo-reno-11-pro-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual/"><u>In 2024, 10 Free Location Spoofers to Fake GPS Location on your Oppo Reno 11 Pro 5G | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://apple-account.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-remove-an-airtag-from-your-apple-id-account-on-iphone-8-plus-by-drfone-ios/"><u>In 2024, How to Remove an AirTag from Your Apple ID Account On iPhone 8 Plus?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirror.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-screen-mirroring-xiaomi-redmi-note-12-proplus-5g-to-pc-drfone-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, How to Screen Mirroring Xiaomi Redmi Note 12 Pro+ 5G to PC? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://review-topics.techidaily.com/recover-permanently-deleted-or-erased-excel-2013-files-for-free-stellar-by-stellar-guide/"><u>Recover Permanently Deleted or Erased Excel 2013 Files for Free | Stellar</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

Filmora has a tool that will help you do this; it’s located in the viewer panel, and you can access it by clicking on the Crop Pan button. An online aspect ratio calculator will help you calculate pixel dimension and aspect ratio to ensure they match.</p><p>Now, go back to the Filmora video editing software and navigate to the Crop and Pan screen. You need to click the Manual option and manually type in the number to resize your video.</p><p>Adjust the position of the crop tool and then hit the OK button. Keep in mind that the export process for a portrait and landscape video is almost similar; however, you have to change the resolution. You can do this by clicking the Resolution drop-down menu and choosing the custom option. Insert the weight and height values you entered in the cropping tool and export the video.</p><p>* Square (1:1)</p><p>To create a square video for Instagram, you’ll need to follow the same process as that of creating portrait videos; however, make sure that the weight and height values are the same. Once this is done, you need to adjust the crop rectangle to ensure it’s in the correct position before clicking the OK button.</p><p>The process for exporting videos is similar to that of portrait videos. Before clicking the Export button, be sure to adjust the resolution of your video to 1080X1080.</p><p>* Landscape (16:9)</p><p>Videos recorded by cameras record are often in the landscape aspect ratio. As such, before exporting your video, be sure to check the frame rate and resolution of the video clip you would like to export. In the media panel, right-click on your video clip and select Properties. Once you find these details, hit the Export button.</p><p>A new window will pop up; hit the Format icon on the upper left side of your screen. Choose the MP4 format and name the video file. Don’t forget to specify the location you would like to export the file.</p><p>Click Settings and set the Quality of your video by choosing the Best option. Now, you need to select an HD format located in the Encoder menu.</p><p>It is time to select the Frame rate and Resolution matching the ones in the video clip. Navigate to the Audio Settings and change the Bitrate to 128 Kbps. Once you have done this, click on the OK button. You can now upload your video on Instagram and share it with your followers.</p><h3 id="Upload-Videos-With-No-Crop"><a href="#Upload-Videos-With-No-Crop" class="headerlink" title="Upload Videos With No Crop"></a>Upload Videos With No Crop</h3><p>Available in Google Play Store and the App Store, No Crop video Instagram allows you to post videos without cropping.

Filmora has a tool that will help you do this; it’s located in the viewer panel, and you can access it by clicking on the Crop Pan button.

You need to click the Manual option and manually type in the number to resize your video.</p><p>Adjust the position of the crop tool and then hit the OK button. Keep in mind that the export process for a portrait and landscape video is almost similar; however, you have to change the resolution. You can do this by clicking the Resolution drop-down menu and choosing the custom option. Insert the weight and height values you entered in the cropping tool and export the video.</p><p>* Square (1:1)</p><p>To create a square video for Instagram, you’ll need to follow the same process as that of creating portrait videos; however, make sure that the weight and height values are the same. Once this is done, you need to adjust the crop rectangle to ensure it’s in the correct position before clicking the OK button.</p><p>The process for exporting videos is similar to that of portrait videos. Before clicking the Export button, be sure to adjust the resolution of your video to 1080X1080.</p><p>* Landscape (16:9)</p><p>Videos recorded by cameras record are often in the landscape aspect ratio. As such, before exporting your video, be sure to check the frame rate and resolution of the video clip you would like to export. In the media panel, right-click on your video clip and select Properties. Once you find these details, hit the Export button.</p><p>A new window will pop up; hit the Format icon on the upper left side of your screen. Choose the MP4 format and name the video file. Don’t forget to specify the location you would like to export the file.</p><p>Click Settings and set the Quality of your video by choosing the Best option. Now, you need to select an HD format located in the Encoder menu.</p><p>It is time to select the Frame rate and Resolution matching the ones in the video clip.

Filmora has a tool that will help you do this; it’s located in the viewer panel, and you can access it by clicking on the Crop Pan button. An online aspect ratio calculator will help you calculate pixel dimension and aspect ratio to ensure they match.</p><p>Now, go back to the Filmora video editing software and navigate to the Crop and Pan screen. You need to click the Manual option and manually type in the number to resize your video.</p><p>Adjust the position of the crop tool and then hit the OK button. Keep in mind that the export process for a portrait and landscape video is almost similar; however, you have to change the resolution. You can do this by clicking the Resolution drop-down menu and choosing the custom option. Insert the weight and height values you entered in the cropping tool and export the video.</p><p>* Square (1:1)</p><p>To create a square video for Instagram, you’ll need to follow the same process as that of creating portrait videos; however, make sure that the weight and height values are the same. Once this is done, you need to adjust the crop rectangle to ensure it’s in the correct position before clicking the OK button.</p><p>The process for exporting videos is similar to that of portrait videos. Before clicking the Export button, be sure to adjust the resolution of your video to 1080X1080.</p><p>* Landscape (16:9)</p><p>Videos recorded by cameras record are often in the landscape aspect ratio. As such, before exporting your video, be sure to check the frame rate and resolution of the video clip you would like to export. In the media panel, right-click on your video clip and select Properties. Once you find these details, hit the Export button.</p><p>A new window will pop up; hit the Format icon on the upper left side of your screen. Choose the MP4 format and name the video file. Don’t forget to specify the location you would like to export the file.</p><p>Click Settings and set the Quality of your video by choosing the Best option. Now, you need to select an HD format located in the Encoder menu.</p><p>It is time to select the Frame rate and Resolution matching the ones in the video clip. Navigate to the Audio Settings and change the Bitrate to 128 Kbps. Once you have done this, click on the OK button. You can now upload your video on Instagram and share it with your followers.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134233/18498" target="_top" id="2134233">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134233" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134233/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Upload-Videos-With-No-Crop-2"><a href="#Upload-Videos-With-No-Crop-2" class="headerlink" title="Upload Videos With No Crop"></a>Upload Videos With No Crop</h3><p>Available in Google Play Store and the App Store, No Crop video Instagram allows you to post videos without cropping.

Filmora has a tool that will help you do this; it’s located in the viewer panel, and you can access it by clicking on the Crop Pan button. An online aspect ratio calculator will help you calculate pixel dimension and aspect ratio to ensure they match.</p><p>Now, go back to the Filmora video editing software and navigate to the Crop and Pan screen. You need to click the Manual option and manually type in the number to resize your video.</p><p>Adjust the position of the crop tool and then hit the OK button. Keep in mind that the export process for a portrait and landscape video is almost similar; however, you have to change the resolution. You can do this by clicking the Resolution drop-down menu and choosing the custom option. Insert the weight and height values you entered in the cropping tool and export the video.</p><p>* Square (1:1)</p><p>To create a square video for Instagram, you’ll need to follow the same process as that of creating portrait videos; however, make sure that the weight and height values are the same. Once this is done, you need to adjust the crop rectangle to ensure it’s in the correct position before clicking the OK button.</p><p>The process for exporting videos is similar to that of portrait videos. Before clicking the Export button, be sure to adjust the resolution of your video to 1080X1080.</p><p>* Landscape (16:9)</p><p>Videos recorded by cameras record are often in the landscape aspect ratio. As such, before exporting your video, be sure to check the frame rate and resolution of the video clip you would like to export. In the media panel, right-click on your video clip and select Properties. Once you find these details, hit the Export button.</p><p>A new window will pop up; hit the Format icon on the upper left side of your screen. Choose the MP4 format and name the video file. Don’t forget to specify the location you would like to export the file.</p><p>Click Settings and set the Quality of your video by choosing the Best option. Now, you need to select an HD format located in the Encoder menu.</p><p>It is time to select the Frame rate and Resolution matching the ones in the video clip. Navigate to the Audio Settings and change the Bitrate to 128 Kbps. Once you have done this, click on the OK button. You can now upload your video on Instagram and share it with your followers.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1495277">                    <video width="1536" height="864" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1495277.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17189-1495277">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1495277.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:960px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Ffunwhole.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1495277%2F17189'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1495277/17189"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Upload-Videos-With-No-Crop-3"><a href="#Upload-Videos-With-No-Crop-3" class="headerlink" title="Upload Videos With No Crop"></a>Upload Videos With No Crop</h3><p>Available in Google Play Store and the App Store, No Crop video Instagram allows you to post videos without cropping.

Here is the answer:</p><p>Wait!</p><p>What is your Instagram profile picture size? It is your trademark! Therefore, it matters a lot.

Once you open IGTV on your iPhone, you will be able to see the videos the platform suggests you should watch in <strong>the For You</strong> section. When you come across an IGTV video you no longer want to see, simply <strong>swipe down</strong>, and then <strong>tap on the three-dot icon</strong> that is located next to the Like, Comment and Share buttons.</p><p> A four-option menu will pop up on the screen, so you just have to <strong>tap on the Hide feature</strong>, and the platform will immediately remove the video you no longer want to see and the next video will start playing automatically.</p><p> The process of reporting an IGTV video from an Android device is nearly identical to the process of hiding a video on an iPhone. <strong>The only difference is</strong>, that you should select the <strong>Report option</strong> in the menu that pops up on the screen after you tap on the three dot icon. Using the Hide or Report options will enable IGTV to understand what type of content you like. That’s why you shouldn’t hesitate to use these options every time you see a video that covers a topic you’re not interested in or if you find its content offensive.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p> Optimizing IGTV in accordance with your interests and tastes doesn’t require much effort, as you can easily hide or report IGTV videos you don’t want to interact with.

The main point here is, one needs to have a verified account by Instagram or a <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >business profil <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> with at least 10000 followers.

It’s a big thing to get that, unless you are a public figure. Alternatively, you can just have a text overlay that displays your URL, though, it is not clickable. Future updates might support sharing links on Instagram Stories for all.</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong> – Take a shot or record a video using the Instagram Stories camera or select a recently (within 24 hours) clicked photo by swiping the screen up.</p><p><strong>Step 2</strong> – Now, tap the chain icon from the top right corner of the screen and enter the desired URL.

One of the best ways to do that is by using a reliable <strong>Instagram grid maker</strong>. For instance, with an Instagram grid planner, you can come up with an overall theme for your profile or connect various posts via a puzzle. To help you elevate the creative and visual appeal of your profile, I’m going to make you familiar with the 10 best grid makers for Instagram.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: What are Instagram Grids All About?</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 2: The 6 Best Online Grid Makers for Instagram</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Part 3: Top 4 Grid Makers for Instagram [for Android and iOS]</a></li><li><a href="#part4">Part 4: How to Make an Appealing Photo Grid on Instagram?</a></li><li><a href="#part5">Part 5: Creative Ideas to Implement Instagram Grid Layouts</a></li></ul><h2 id="Part-1-What-are-Instagram-Grids-All-About"><a href="#Part-1-What-are-Instagram-Grids-All-About" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What are Instagram Grids All About?"></a>Part 1: What are Instagram Grids All About?</h2><p>You might already know that Instagram displays our posts in a 3-column layout. Therefore, to make the most of this layout, a lot of people work on the overall 3x3 grid (3 rows and 3 columns).</p><p>To catch the attention of their audience, you can come up with an overall theme for your profile using 9 posts (a 3x3 grid). For instance, you can see here is a perfect example of a puzzle grid in which some parts of a post are overlapping on the adjacent posts.

To get better results for your Instagram’s grid layout, you can consider following these expert suggestions:</p><h4 id="Consistency-is-the-key"><a href="#Consistency-is-the-key" class="headerlink" title="Consistency is the key"></a>Consistency is the key</h4><p>A lot of people simply think that coming up with 9 posts for Instagram would make your profile look visually appealing. It might attract your audience, but you need to maintain a consistent appeal throughout your profile. To do that, you need to ensure that all the upcoming posts would follow the same pattern and appeal.</p><h4 id="Align-it-with-your-brand’s-vision"><a href="#Align-it-with-your-brand’s-vision" class="headerlink" title="Align it with your brand’s vision"></a>Align it with your brand’s vision</h4><p>Don’t come up with a grid layout for Instagram just for the sake of it. You need to make sure that it is aligned with the overall look and feel of your brand. Also, your Instagram page should remain authentic with the message of your brand and its image.</p><h4 id="Focus-on-color-combinations"><a href="#Focus-on-color-combinations" class="headerlink" title="Focus on color combinations"></a>Focus on color combinations</h4><p>Just splitting your images into a 3x3 grid is not enough. You need to maintain the overall visual appeal of your profile by sticking to certain color combinations. You can either maintain a single-colored layout or mix two or three colors to come up with a consistent look.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/fashion-puzzle-template-ig.jpg"                      alt="fashion puzzle template ig"                ></p><h4 id="Preview-before-posting"><a href="#Preview-before-posting" class="headerlink" title="Preview before posting"></a>Preview before posting</h4><p>Most importantly, try to get a preview of your Instagram grid before posting it on your profile. There are all kinds of preview apps (mobile and online) that you can try to do the same. In this way, you can easily notice if there is an alignment issue with your photos before posting them on your profile.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://25home.pxf.io/c/5597632/2123468/16836" target="_top" id="2123468">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16836-2123468" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="125" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://25home.pxf.io/i/5597632/2123468/16836"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>Well, now it’s your turn to come up with some stunning grid layouts for your Instagram profile!

To use this free photo grid Instagram tool, just go through these steps:</p><p><strong>Step 1: Upload the image you want to split</strong></p><p>At first, you can just go to the official website of Image Splitter by Postcron and click on the “Upload Image” button from its home. This will open a dedicated Instagram grid maker online tool.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/upload-image-splitter.jpg"                      alt="upload image splitter"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2126493/26400" target="_top" id="2126493">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2126493" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="640" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2126493/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>You can now just drag and drop an image that you want to split or click on the “Upload” button to browse and load it from your computer.</p><p><strong>Step 2: Choose how you want to split the image</strong></p><p>Great! Once the image has been loaded, you can simply check its preview on the side. Now, you can just crop the part of the image that you want to split from here. On the side, you can just enter the number of rows and columns in which you want to split the image. For instance, to get a 3x3 Instagram grid layout, you can set the number of columns and rows as 3.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/choose-how-split-image.jpg"                      alt="choose how split image"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="2135472">                    <video width="864" height="1536" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/2135472.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2135472">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/2135472.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:540px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Funicoeye.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F2135472%2F18498'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2135472/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><strong>Step 3: Split your image and save all photos</strong></p><p>After setting a preferred ratio for the grid, you can also select a respective image format to export your files (like JPG or PNG).

To get better results for your Instagram’s grid layout, you can consider following these expert suggestions:</p><h4 id="Consistency-is-the-key-3"><a href="#Consistency-is-the-key-3" class="headerlink" title="Consistency is the key"></a>Consistency is the key</h4><p>A lot of people simply think that coming up with 9 posts for Instagram would make your profile look visually appealing. It might attract your audience, but you need to maintain a consistent appeal throughout your profile. To do that, you need to ensure that all the upcoming posts would follow the same pattern and appeal.</p><h4 id="Align-it-with-your-brand’s-vision-3"><a href="#Align-it-with-your-brand’s-vision-3" class="headerlink" title="Align it with your brand’s vision"></a>Align it with your brand’s vision</h4><p>Don’t come up with a grid layout for Instagram just for the sake of it. You need to make sure that it is aligned with the overall look and feel of your brand. Also, your Instagram page should remain authentic with the message of your brand and its image.</p><h4 id="Focus-on-color-combinations-3"><a href="#Focus-on-color-combinations-3" class="headerlink" title="Focus on color combinations"></a>Focus on color combinations</h4><p>Just splitting your images into a 3x3 grid is not enough. You need to maintain the overall visual appeal of your profile by sticking to certain color combinations. You can either maintain a single-colored layout or mix two or three colors to come up with a consistent look.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/fashion-puzzle-template-ig.jpg"                      alt="fashion puzzle template ig"                ></p><h4 id="Preview-before-posting-3"><a href="#Preview-before-posting-3" class="headerlink" title="Preview before posting"></a>Preview before posting</h4><p>Most importantly, try to get a preview of your Instagram grid before posting it on your profile. There are all kinds of preview apps (mobile and online) that you can try to do the same. In this way, you can easily notice if there is an alignment issue with your photos before posting them on your profile.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2115941/19272" target="_top" id="2115941">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2115941" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="125" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2115941/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Conclusion-3"><a href="#Conclusion-3" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>Well, now it’s your turn to come up with some stunning grid layouts for your Instagram profile!

Influencers are content creators on Instagram who also build communities across a particular niche or topic. Being a visually rich platform you always need the most visually dynamic content for better performance.</p><p>These content creators&#x2F;influencers usually focus on photography, travel, beauty, fashion, food, fitness, lifestyle, or celebrities sharing their personal lives on Instagram.

It should be something that suits your personality and makes you feel connected. You need to have some basic knowledge of that and curiosity to delve deeper.</p><p>On social media, you can’t fake it if it’s not your passion, somewhere or the other your true persona will take over. So, be very careful about that and don’t follow a niche that is trending, rather build what interests you. DIY crafts, kitchen hacks, travel, lifestyle, food, and so on are there to pick from.</p><p>Rather than posting random things, figure out what can go in combo and curate your content. For example, you love fashion and good at DIY.

It should be something that suits your personality and makes you feel connected. You need to have some basic knowledge of that and curiosity to delve deeper.</p><p>On social media, you can’t fake it if it’s not your passion, somewhere or the other your true persona will take over. So, be very careful about that and don’t follow a niche that is trending, rather build what interests you. DIY crafts, kitchen hacks, travel, lifestyle, food, and so on are there to pick from.</p><p>Rather than posting random things, figure out what can go in combo and curate your content. For example, you love fashion and good at DIY. Then you can show how to make DIY clothing, accessories, recycle things, etc. and retain your posts’ originality.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ins-find-niche.JPG"                      alt="ins find niche"                ></p><h3 id="Step-2-Create-your-hashtags-3"><a href="#Step-2-Create-your-hashtags-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Create your hashtags"></a>Step 2: Create your <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >hashtags <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>Before you become an Instagram influencer, it is essential to understand the value of #hashtags.

Here are some helpful hints:</p><ul><li>If you’re worried your IG Feed video is too long and don’t want to edit it, make a video carousel post by breaking it up into smaller chunks. By swiping the post, the viewer will be able to see everything.</li><li>If you felt pressed to stay inside the time limit and made a video that was far too short, you can add more footage, slow it down, or add a loop. Another option is to use a video editor to make an intro and an end screen.</li><li>If your Instagram story is too long, you can cut it down using any Instagram video editor. Record the video, then open it in your app to edit and trim it down before selecting the clips to upload the full story.</li><li>In addition, if your Instagram ad video is longer than 15 seconds, Instagram provides 10 cards, each with a 15-second video duration limit. This will allow you to show your complete advertisement without compressing it.</li><li>The four-hour limit seems insufficient if you wish to have a more extended live stream on Instagram. Then, as soon as you reach the time restriction, you can easily go live again and re-start the stream as many times as you wish.</li><li>To make videos that will receive hundreds of likes on Instagram, you’ll need video editing software that allows you to change the aspect ratio of the videos you wish to submit. Wondershare Filmora is a video editing program that supports a wide range of video file formats and allows you to crop and prepare your videos for web use.</li></ul><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For Win 7 or later (64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For macOS 10.12 or later</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p><strong>●</strong> That’s all there is to know about the length of Instagram videos.

Instagram Stories already have excellent engagement rates, with one out of every five stories receiving a direct reply from viewers.</p><p>The maximum length of an Instagram Story video ad is two minutes. You can utilize different story cards if you want to show your ad on an Instagram story. Each card can display a 15-second video or a single 5-second picture ad. Only the first three cards of a complete ad will appear in the Instagram story stream. After that, after touching on the ad, the viewer must choose whether or not to see more.</p><p>Furthermore, Instagram Stories will show 15-second or shorter video advertising for the duration of the video. Video ads lasting more than 10 seconds will be broken into different Stories cards.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134492/18498" target="_top" id="2134492">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134492" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134492/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-Do-You-Adjust-The-Duration-Of-Your-Video-For-Instagram-3"><a href="#How-Do-You-Adjust-The-Duration-Of-Your-Video-For-Instagram-3" class="headerlink" title="How Do You Adjust The Duration Of Your Video For Instagram?"></a>How Do You Adjust The Duration Of Your Video For Instagram?</h2><p>You must be thinking about how to upload flawlessly every time with all of these time limits and video publication options. Here are some helpful hints:</p><ul><li>If you’re worried your IG Feed video is too long and don’t want to edit it, make a video carousel post by breaking it up into smaller chunks. By swiping the post, the viewer will be able to see everything.</li><li>If you felt pressed to stay inside the time limit and made a video that was far too short, you can add more footage, slow it down, or add a loop. Another option is to use a video editor to make an intro and an end screen.</li><li>If your Instagram story is too long, you can cut it down using any Instagram video editor. Record the video, then open it in your app to edit and trim it down before selecting the clips to upload the full story.</li><li>In addition, if your Instagram ad video is longer than 15 seconds, Instagram provides 10 cards, each with a 15-second video duration limit. This will allow you to show your complete advertisement without compressing it.</li><li>The four-hour limit seems insufficient if you wish to have a more extended live stream on Instagram. Then, as soon as you reach the time restriction, you can easily go live again and re-start the stream as many times as you wish.</li><li>To make videos that will receive hundreds of likes on Instagram, you’ll need video editing software that allows you to change the aspect ratio of the videos you wish to submit. Wondershare Filmora is a video editing program that supports a wide range of video file formats and allows you to crop and prepare your videos for web use.</li></ul><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For Win 7 or later (64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For macOS 10.12 or later</p><h2 id="Conclusion-3"><a href="#Conclusion-3" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p><strong>●</strong> That’s all there is to know about the length of Instagram videos.
