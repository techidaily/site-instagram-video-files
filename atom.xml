Since its inception, Instagram has grown in popularity as a method to engage with brands, celebrities, thought leaders, friends, family, and more. The launch of Instagram’s IGTv function was a great success, and the platform isn’t stopping there. Soon later, in the summer of 2019, Instagram added a new feature: you may now video chat with one or more of your friends in direct messaging without having to leave Instagram. This innovation will help Instagram to retain its users on the platform for longer than before, obviating the need for third-party programs such as Skype and Facetime.</p><h4 id="In-this-article-3"><a href="#In-this-article-3" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 <a href="#part1">What Is The Most Important Information You Should Know About Instagram?</a></p><p>02 <a href="#part2">How To Use Instagram Video Chat?</a></p><p>03 <a href="#part3">Things You Should Pay Attention To While Using Youtube Video Chat</a></p><h2 id="What-Is-The-Most-Important-Information-You-Should-Know-About-Instagram-3"><a href="#What-Is-The-Most-Important-Information-You-Should-Know-About-Instagram-3" class="headerlink" title="What Is The Most Important Information You Should Know About Instagram?"></a>What Is The Most Important Information You Should Know About Instagram?</h2><p>Instagram is a photo and video-sharing social networking platform with a smartphone app. You may create, modify, and share visual content so that your followers can interact with it through likes, comments</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/instagram-video-chat-1.jpg"                      alt="instgram video chat"                ></p><h4 id="When-Is-It-Introduced-3"><a href="#When-Is-It-Introduced-3" class="headerlink" title="When Is It Introduced?"></a>When Is It Introduced?</h4><p>Instagram is the most popular social networking platform in the world.

The action looks so slow that you think everything has stopped moving but in reality, it hasn’t – just slower than our eyes can normally perceive.</p><p>Slow-motion video is popular on Instagram Reels as well. In this article, we will show you how to</p><h4 id="In-this-article"><a href="#In-this-article" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 <a href="#part1">What is Slow Motion?</a></p><p>02 <a href="#part2">How Does Slow Motion Work On Instagram Reels?</a></p><p>03 <a href="#part3">How To Make Slow Motion Video On Instagram Reels?</a></p><p>04 <a href="#part4">How To Record Only Part Of A Video In Slow Motion On Reels?</a></p><p>05 <a href="#part5">How to Convert Normal Speed Video to Slow Motion For Reels?</a></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Slow-Motion"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Slow-Motion" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is Slow Motion?"></a>Part 1: What is Slow Motion?</h2><p>Slow-motion can be achieved by either dropping frames from a video sequence, or simply playing the existing frames in slow succession. It lets you capture some fun clips by turning everyday things into something special. For example, water droplets falling and causing different effects as they splatter and spread can be really fascinating to see, just like paint dropping onto a giant canvas.</p><p>That’s why it is very important to use high-resolution recording when shooting such video to prevent the stuttering effect. The higher the frame rate, the more we can slow down the action without noticeable jarring because each frame will be captured in more detail.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-Does-Slow-Motion-Work-On-Instagram-Reels"><a href="#Part-2-How-Does-Slow-Motion-Work-On-Instagram-Reels" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How Does Slow Motion Work On Instagram Reels?"></a>Part 2: How Does Slow Motion Work On Instagram Reels?</h2><p>Instagram Reels is a new feature within the Instagram app where users can create short 15-second videos and add them to their Instagram Stories. The new tool plays with time and motion in a creative way by letting you record clips but only keeps the last 15 seconds. While this might seem to limit at first, it actually opens up some creative possibilities for creating interesting vignettes. But how does the Instagram reels slow motion function work?</p><p>The secret behind Instagram reels slow-motion lies in its audio features. When recording a video, regardless of whether it’s in normal or slow-motion mode, you’ll be able to select songs from any music library that’s available on your device, add sound effects, and add voiceovers. Instagram takes advantage of this by speeding up the audio to a normal speed when you’re recording in slow motion and then slowing it down just enough so that it sounds natural when you playback the video at 1x speed. This means that your Reels videos will have a consistent volume even if you choose a song from a playlist with differing volumes.</p><p>This gives Reels users an interesting option: they can use songs from playlists where each track varies in terms of volume, thus creating some sort of visual story-telling through their 15-second clips.</p><p>But that’s not all; once you’ve recorded your video, you can add filters and editing tools to give it even more life.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-To-Make-Slow-Motion-Video-On-Instagram-Reels"><a href="#Part-3-How-To-Make-Slow-Motion-Video-On-Instagram-Reels" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How To Make Slow Motion Video On Instagram Reels?"></a>Part 3: How To Make Slow Motion Video On Instagram Reels?</h2><p>Instagram Reels is a feature that lets users create short videos consisting of multiple photos or clips placed together in order of their choice. The reels can be created from posts made by the user as well as from the user’s camera roll containing photos and videos taken before. These can even be edited further to add some filters or text to them.

When recording a video, regardless of whether it’s in normal or slow-motion mode, you’ll be able to select songs from any music library that’s available on your device, add sound effects, and add voiceovers. Instagram takes advantage of this by speeding up the audio to a normal speed when you’re recording in slow motion and then slowing it down just enough so that it sounds natural when you playback the video at 1x speed. This means that your Reels videos will have a consistent volume even if you choose a song from a playlist with differing volumes.</p><p>This gives Reels users an interesting option: they can use songs from playlists where each track varies in terms of volume, thus creating some sort of visual story-telling through their 15-second clips.</p><p>But that’s not all; once you’ve recorded your video, you can add filters and editing tools to give it even more life.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-To-Make-Slow-Motion-Video-On-Instagram-Reels-2"><a href="#Part-3-How-To-Make-Slow-Motion-Video-On-Instagram-Reels-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How To Make Slow Motion Video On Instagram Reels?"></a>Part 3: How To Make Slow Motion Video On Instagram Reels?</h2><p>Instagram Reels is a feature that lets users create short videos consisting of multiple photos or clips placed together in order of their choice.

Thanks to IGTV, it supports videos longer than 60 seconds on the main feed. IGTV only supports limited dimensional video, i.e., 4:5 a minimum and 9:16 maximum ratio.</p><p>However, Instagram also supports landscape videos, portrait videos, and square videos. Being a content creator, you need a good video editor to edit and remove the background of your Instagram videos.

The time zone in which your ideal viewer lives in or their age play an important role in choosing the time when you post new content to your IGTV channel. In general, the best time to post new videos on IGTV is from 8 p.m. to 10 p.m. from Monday to Thursday, but you should try posting at different times of the day and see what produces the best results.</p><p> Posting new videos on your IGTV channel regularly is probably more important than sharing videos at an exact same time because your followers will gradually learn your posting habits.

Share Your IGTV Videos on Facebook and Other Social Media</h4><p> IGTV is a relatively new platform, which means that it still doesn’t have as many users as social networks such as Facebook or Twitter. That is the reason why you shouldn’t focus exclusively on IGTV in your social media marketing efforts because you can amass a large number of followers on all popular social media platforms. Sharing an IGTV video on Facebook, for example, can help you gain access to a larger audience since you will enable your current followers to share your videos with their friends on that platform. In addition, the people who like the videos you post on your IGTV channel can become your followers, even if they found out about your IGTV channel on some other social network.</p><p> <strong>Tips and Tricks</strong> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >3 Ways to Share IGTV Videos on Facebook <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h4 id="4-Improve-the-Quality-of-the-Content-Constantly"><a href="#4-Improve-the-Quality-of-the-Content-Constantly" class="headerlink" title="4.

Purchasing a camera that is capable of recording HD or 4K videos and all other equipment that is necessary for the production of professional-looking videos can help you capture the videos in better quality. However, the stories your videos tell are equally important, which is why you need to choose the topics of your IGTV videos carefully. Writing a script for each new IGTV video you’re planning on shooting should make it easier for you to create captivating content that is going to attract new followers.</p><h4 id="5-Interact-and-Connect-With-IGTV-Users"><a href="#5-Interact-and-Connect-With-IGTV-Users" class="headerlink" title="5.

A simple mention from someone who already has thousands of followers can do miracles for your IGTV account, which makes networking one of the most significant parts of the process of gathering new followers. Furthermore, you should reply to all the comments on your videos, and use every opportunity to interact with the followers you already have.

Discover the Best Time to Post New Videos and Share New Content Frequently"></a>2. Discover the Best Time to Post New Videos and Share New Content Frequently</h4><p> Once again, knowing your audience and when they are the most likely to be using IGTV is essential for boosting the number of followers. The time zone in which your ideal viewer lives in or their age play an important role in choosing the time when you post new content to your IGTV channel. In general, the best time to post new videos on IGTV is from 8 p.m. to 10 p.m. from Monday to Thursday, but you should try posting at different times of the day and see what produces the best results.</p><p> Posting new videos on your IGTV channel regularly is probably more important than sharing videos at an exact same time because your followers will gradually learn your posting habits. Upload new content at least once a week and do your best to stick to your posting schedule. Pick one or more days when you share videos and your followers will always know when they can expect your new content.</p><h4 id="3-Share-Your-IGTV-Videos-on-Facebook-and-Other-Social-Media-3"><a href="#3-Share-Your-IGTV-Videos-on-Facebook-and-Other-Social-Media-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Share Your IGTV Videos on Facebook and Other Social Media"></a>3. Share Your IGTV Videos on Facebook and Other Social Media</h4><p> IGTV is a relatively new platform, which means that it still doesn’t have as many users as social networks such as Facebook or Twitter. That is the reason why you shouldn’t focus exclusively on IGTV in your social media marketing efforts because you can amass a large number of followers on all popular social media platforms. Sharing an IGTV video on Facebook, for example, can help you gain access to a larger audience since you will enable your current followers to share your videos with their friends on that platform. In addition, the people who like the videos you post on your IGTV channel can become your followers, even if they found out about your IGTV channel on some other social network.</p><p> <strong>Tips and Tricks</strong> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >3 Ways to Share IGTV Videos on Facebook <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h4 id="4-Improve-the-Quality-of-the-Content-Constantly-3"><a href="#4-Improve-the-Quality-of-the-Content-Constantly-3" class="headerlink" title="4. Improve the Quality of the Content Constantly"></a>4. Improve the Quality of the Content Constantly</h4><p> Both the topics of your IGTV videos and their quality matter, so if you are just starting out you should strive to improve the overall quality of the content you post on your channel through time. Purchasing a camera that is capable of recording HD or 4K videos and all other equipment that is necessary for the production of professional-looking videos can help you capture the videos in better quality. However, the stories your videos tell are equally important, which is why you need to choose the topics of your IGTV videos carefully. Writing a script for each new IGTV video you’re planning on shooting should make it easier for you to create captivating content that is going to attract new followers.</p><h4 id="5-Interact-and-Connect-With-IGTV-Users-3"><a href="#5-Interact-and-Connect-With-IGTV-Users-3" class="headerlink" title="5. Interact and Connect With IGTV Users"></a>5. Interact and Connect With IGTV Users</h4><p> Dedicate time to discovering the most influential IGTV users in your niche, and then make an effort to connect with them. A simple mention from someone who already has thousands of followers can do miracles for your IGTV account, which makes networking one of the most significant parts of the process of gathering new followers. Furthermore, you should reply to all the comments on your videos, and use every opportunity to interact with the followers you already have. By doing so, you will show your appreciation for the support your channel is already receiving, which may prompt some of your followers to recommend your IGTV account to their friends.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p> Each niche of IGTV videos is slightly different, and the methods you’re going to utilize to increase the number of followers you have on your channel depends on the type of content you are posting on this platform. The best time of the day to share new IGTV videos or which keywords you include in your profile depend on the audience you’re targeting, so you must do thorough research of the market before you start uploading videos to your IGTV channel.

After all, you might want to see it again. But, if you’ve ever tried to download Instagram videos on PC or Mac, you’ll know it’s not all that easy. You can’t do it straight from the app or website, so how can you make it work?</p><p>Here, we’ll highlight a few tried and tested methods of how to download Instagram videos so that you can save all your favorites for evermore.</p><h2 id="How-to-download-Instagram-videos-on-PC-and-Mac-3"><a href="#How-to-download-Instagram-videos-on-PC-and-Mac-3" class="headerlink" title="How to download Instagram videos on PC and Mac"></a>How to download Instagram videos on PC and Mac</h2><p>There are a few <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >different solutions to help you download Instagram videos on PC or Mac <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, some of which require at least a degree in coding to get your head around.

Well, it doesn’t really matter what it is, and you don’t need to understand it at all, because all you’re looking for here is a little link that will let you download the video directly to your computer. Here’s how you do it:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/how-to-download-instagram-videos-on-pc-and-mac-01.jpg"                      alt="Source code"                ></p><ul><li>Open the video you’d like to download on Instagram</li><li>Right-click (or on a Mac, ⌘+click) and choose ‘inspect element’ or ‘view page source’, depending on the specific browser that you’re using.</li><li>Press Ctrl+F (or ⌘+F on a Mac) to open the ‘find’ menu</li><li>Type in .mp4 into the box, and the search will return a section of code</li><li>Look for a hyperlinked bit of code that is next to ‘src&#x3D;’ and ends with .mp4</li><li>Select this, and copy it using Ctrl+C (or ⌘+C), and then paste it into your browser using Ctrl+P (or ⌘+P)</li><li>The video will play in the window. Simply right-click (or ⌘+click) and select ‘save video as’ to download the video to your PC’s hard drive</li></ul><p>This might sound all a bit cumbersome, but once you’ve had a couple of goes you’ll find it’s not as hard as it looks. If you’re not used to keyboard shortcuts you might have a bit of a learning curve to traverse, but overall, it’s a tried and tested method to download Instagram videos on PC and Mac that is popular with many users.</p><p>Please check this video to know more details:</p><h3 id="Method-2-Online-solutions-3"><a href="#Method-2-Online-solutions-3" class="headerlink" title="Method 2: Online solutions"></a>Method 2: Online solutions</h3><p>If you’d prefer a more elegant way to download Instagram videos on PC or Mac, there are numerous online solutions that can work for you.

Don’t you worry anymore; Instagram has got it all! Over the years, Instagram has introduced many new features and has become a one-stop-shop for social media users.</p><p>Instagram initially started with the option of only uploading pictures in 2010. Two years later, in 2012, Mark Zuckerberg bought Instagram, and since then, it has been a competitor to many apps. Introducing the chat feature, stories, IGTV, and its most recent update of the Instagram Reels, Instagram continues to seize the market. It is now the sixth most popular social media platform with more than one billion active users.</p><p>Here, in this article, we will familiarize you with how to make and create reels on Instagram and 10 interesting facts about the latest update.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">10 Facts You Need to Know about Instagram Reels</a></li><li><a href="#part2">FAQs about Instagram Reels</a></li></ul><h2 id="10-Facts-You-Need-to-Know-about-Instagram-Reels"><a href="#10-Facts-You-Need-to-Know-about-Instagram-Reels" class="headerlink" title="10 Facts You Need to Know about Instagram Reels"></a>10 Facts You Need to Know about Instagram Reels</h2><p>Instagramreels are short 15-second multi-clip videos with audio, effects, and other exciting editing tools.

Why Instagram launched Reels? Copy TikTok?"></a>#1. Why Instagram launched Reels? Copy TikTok?</h3><p>As a competitor to various apps, Instagram has adapted to the latest trends pretty quickly. With the boom of TikTok, Instagram followed suit and launched Reels to attract content creators and different brands. During the lockdown, people all over the world have taken over TikTok to get rid of their boredom. Instagram Reels is practically the same thing as TikTok. The few differences are that Instagram provides many other features as well but on the other hand time limit on TikTok is up to 1 minute. Furthermore, Reels disappear after 24 hours, where TikTok videos don’t.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/1-why-launch-instagram.jpg"                      alt="why launch instagram"                ></p><h3 id="2-Instagram-Reels-was-first-launched-in-Brazil"><a href="#2-Instagram-Reels-was-first-launched-in-Brazil" class="headerlink" title="#2. Instagram Reels was first launched in Brazil"></a>#2. Instagram Reels was first launched in Brazil</h3><p>Instagram launched the Reels update for a trail run in Brazil in November 2019. It allowed Reels to be shared on Stories or via DMs. It is called Cenas in Brazil and is part of the Instagram Stories instead of a separate application.</p><h3 id="3-Instagram-reaches-over-1-Billion-users-every-month"><a href="#3-Instagram-reaches-over-1-Billion-users-every-month" class="headerlink" title="#3. Instagram reaches over 1 Billion users every month"></a>#3. Instagram reaches over 1 Billion users every month</h3><p>Instagram is a worldwide platform that reaches over a billion users every month. This number signifies how widespread its expansion is. Instagram is a site for everyone, be it a regular person, a business, or a celebrity. Its reach encourages people to make accounts and take different business or other initiatives with ease. Introducing the Reels feature will surely increase the number of users as it will attract users of TikTok as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2-instagram-active-user.jpg"                      alt="instagram active user"                ></p><h3 id="4-Instagram-Reels-is-available-in-50-countries-now"><a href="#4-Instagram-Reels-is-available-in-50-countries-now" class="headerlink" title="#4. Instagram Reels is available in 50 countries now"></a>#4. Instagram Reels is available in 50 countries now</h3><p>With a successful trial run in Brazil, Instagram Reels is now available in 50 countries, including the US, the UK, Canada, Australia, Japan, etc. As it gains momentum, we are sure that Facebook will make it available worldwide.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/3-instagram-reels-available-country.jpg"                      alt="instagram available country"                ></p><h3 id="5-People-in-the-US-and-India-use-Instagram-Reels-most"><a href="#5-People-in-the-US-and-India-use-Instagram-Reels-most" class="headerlink" title="#5. People in the US and India use Instagram Reels most"></a>#5. People in the US and India use Instagram Reels most</h3><p>India and the US have been the most responsive to Instagram Reels. Much of this credit goes to the governments of these countries. In December 2019, Trump tried to get TikTok banned. When the position of TikTok was up for grabs, Facebook immediately acted upon it. Similarly, as TikTok has been banned in India, Instagram users are thrilled to get a similar platform where they can make multi-clip videos.</p><h3 id="6-NBA-franchises-are-very-active-on-Instagram-Reels"><a href="#6-NBA-franchises-are-very-active-on-Instagram-Reels" class="headerlink" title="#6. NBA franchises are very active on Instagram Reels"></a>#6. NBA franchises are very active on Instagram Reels</h3><p>Instagram Reels have a very high chance of going viral, especially when famous franchises such as the NBA’s LA Lakers, Houston Rockets, etc., post on it. This feature has increased the engagement rate of the content. Instagram Reels engagement was almost 22 percent higher than a regular Instagram video. It is handy for people who don’t get the time to interact with sports otherwise. They can now get all the info from Insta!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/4-nba-franchises-on-reels.jpg"                      alt="NBA franchises on reels"                ></p><h3 id="7-The-top-5-creators-on-Instagram-Reels-are-Netflix-Red-Bull-Louis-Vuitton-Asos-NBA-Basketball"><a href="#7-The-top-5-creators-on-Instagram-Reels-are-Netflix-Red-Bull-Louis-Vuitton-Asos-NBA-Basketball" class="headerlink" title="#7.

The top 5 creators on Instagram Reels are Netflix, Red Bull, Louis Vuitton, Asos, NBA Basketball</h3><p>Even though Instagram Reels does not offer any ad formats or sponsored content, yet different companies have taken advantage of the Reels to promote their products. Netflix is promoting movies by making short 15 seconds clips and capturing the audience’s curiosity. Red Bull, Louis Vuitton, and Asos have also made Reels featuring their products, maximizing customer engagement. Finally, as mentioned above, NBA franchises are also making their contribution to the success of the Reels.</p><h3 id="8-Shopping-is-coming-to-Instagram-Reels"><a href="#8-Shopping-is-coming-to-Instagram-Reels" class="headerlink" title="#8. Shopping is coming to Instagram Reels"></a>#8. Shopping is coming to Instagram Reels</h3><p>Along with Instagram Reels, Facebook also introduced the Shop tab. Here you can shop on Instagram, support small businesses, and be inspired by your favorite creators. Other than that, Reel creators can tag a product, and people can then click on it to either find more info or buy it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/5-instagram-reels-shopping-feature.jpg"                      alt="instagram reels shopping feature"                ></p><h3 id="9-Instagram-Reels-may-soon-appear-on-Facebook"><a href="#9-Instagram-Reels-may-soon-appear-on-Facebook" class="headerlink" title="#9.

Furthermore, Reels disappear after 24 hours, where TikTok videos don’t.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/1-why-launch-instagram.jpg"                      alt="why launch instagram"                ></p><h3 id="2-Instagram-Reels-was-first-launched-in-Brazil-3"><a href="#2-Instagram-Reels-was-first-launched-in-Brazil-3" class="headerlink" title="#2.

This number signifies how widespread its expansion is. Instagram is a site for everyone, be it a regular person, a business, or a celebrity. Its reach encourages people to make accounts and take different business or other initiatives with ease. Introducing the Reels feature will surely increase the number of users as it will attract users of TikTok as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2-instagram-active-user.jpg"                      alt="instagram active user"                ></p><h3 id="4-Instagram-Reels-is-available-in-50-countries-now-3"><a href="#4-Instagram-Reels-is-available-in-50-countries-now-3" class="headerlink" title="#4.

Reels is a video feature that allows users to make 15-second multi-clip snaps. You can add various effects, set a time limit for the clip, set the speed, and most importantly, you can also add audio (similar to Instagram Music). It was first launched in Brazil as a trial run and is now available in about 50 countries worldwide. Reels have been extremely successful as people from other such apps, e.g., Tiktok, are attracted towards it. Content creators and brands use it for the promotion and marketing of their products.

While Instagram Reels stays in your Reels tab and feed.</li><li><strong>Length:</strong> For the Instagram stories, a video’s maximum length is 15 seconds, and for a picture, it is 7 seconds. For Instagram Reels, the maximum limit is 15 seconds too.</li><li><strong>Hashtags:</strong> Hashtags are used to gain more reach on everything you post. For the Instagram Stories, if you add a hashtag, the users must tap to see your Story. Since there are many stories, the chances of yours showing up are low. Plus, the Story disappears after 24 hours. For Instagram Reels, when a hashtag is searched, the Reels show up at the top due to the algorithm settings. This ensures maximum reach.</li><li><strong>Reach:</strong> Mostly, the people who view Instagram Stories are the followers of the account. In the case of Instagram Reels, people who do not follow can also view your Reels, increasing your reach.</li><li><strong>Saves:</strong> An Instagram Story of someone cannot be saved for you to view later. The Instagram Reels can be saved by the users.</li><li><strong>Explore Page:</strong> Instagram Stories rarely get featured on the explore page. On the other hand, Instagram Reels take the most space, ensuring they are watched the most.</li><li><strong>Editing tools:</strong> For the Stories, you can access filters, different layouts, and camera effects. While Instagram Reels gives access to more devices such as Audio editing, AR effects, Alignment of several clips and pictures, Timer, and Countdown, you can also control your actions’ speed.</li><li><strong>Sharing:</strong> Instagram Stories can be shared as a story or be sent to someone’s inbox, but they disappear 24 hours.

Reels is a video feature that allows users to make 15-second multi-clip snaps. You can add various effects, set a time limit for the clip, set the speed, and most importantly, you can also add audio (similar to Instagram Music). It was first launched in Brazil as a trial run and is now available in about 50 countries worldwide. Reels have been extremely successful as people from other such apps, e.g., Tiktok, are attracted towards it. Content creators and brands use it for the promotion and marketing of their products. Moreover, in the lockdown, it has also proved to be a fun and exciting time pass.</p><p><strong>Instagram Stories</strong> - another product of Instagram is also a video-sharing platform.
