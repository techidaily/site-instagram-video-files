In 2018, social media marketing and Instagram videos seem to be a match made in heaven, due to the platform’s rising popularity and better compatibility with the video content. Ads, Instagrams stories and regular posts on Instagram can all feature short video clips, that last just enough to convey the messages you want your followers to get.</p><p> Getting hundreds or thousands of views for your Instagram videos is not an easy task because you must invest a lot of time, effort and planning if you want your Instagram videos to get the attention they deserve. If you would like to increase the amount views your videos on Instagram are getting, you are at the right place because in this article we will provide you with some useful advice that might help you get more views on each video you post on your Instagram account.</p><p><strong>You May Also Like:</strong>  </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >How to Make Money from Instagram - 2018 Ultimate Guide &gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a><br><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >How to Increase Followers on Instagram &gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="How-do-Instagram-video-views-work-3"><a href="#How-do-Instagram-video-views-work-3" class="headerlink" title="How do Instagram video views work?"></a>How do Instagram video views work?</h2><p> This metric isn’t too important for common Instagram users since most of the people on Instagram don’t use this social media network for professional purposes. Things change drastically if you are using Instagram to promote the services your company offers or to advertise brand’s products.</p><p> A video view is counted if the user of the platform has spent more than three seconds watching any given video. It is safe to say that your followers are going to have to spend a lot of time watching videos you post if you would like to reach the numbers of views videos are getting on other popular social media platforms like YouTube or Facebook.</p><h2 id="How-to-get-more-Instagram-video-views-3"><a href="#How-to-get-more-Instagram-video-views-3" class="headerlink" title="How to get more Instagram video views?"></a>How to get more Instagram video views?</h2><h4 id="1-Pre-edit-videos-on-a-computer-3"><a href="#1-Pre-edit-videos-on-a-computer-3" class="headerlink" title="1.  Pre-edit videos on a computer"></a>1.  Pre-edit videos on a computer</h4><p> Android Smartphones and iPhones can capture high-res videos, but video editing apps still lack the features that video editing software like Wondershare Filmora provides. Pre-editing videos on a computer with Filmora will enable you to produce videos that have 1:1 aspect ratios, or to use some of the stunning visual effects provided by this amazing video editing software.</p><p> Furthermore, the videos edited on a computer will look more professional, because you can use it to add intros or create smooth transitions between the shots in your Instagram video.</p><h4 id="2-Post-the-behind-the-scenes-video-3"><a href="#2-Post-the-behind-the-scenes-video-3" class="headerlink" title="2.  Post the behind the scenes video"></a>2.  Post the behind the scenes video</h4><p> One of the greatest advantages the social media has brought to its users is the instant access to the events or projects that are organized by their favorite brands. Posting videos that show how the behind the scenes of a fashion show or a corporate event looks like will certainly attract a lot of attention from your Instagram followers.</p><p> If you would like to get more views for your Instagram videos, post behind the scenes videos on your Instagram account as often as you can.</p><h4 id="3-Choosing-the-appropriate-hashtags-3"><a href="#3-Choosing-the-appropriate-hashtags-3" class="headerlink" title="3.  Choosing the appropriate hashtags"></a>3.  Choosing the appropriate hashtags</h4><p> A hashtag is a powerful tool that shouldn’t be taken lightly because it is designed to extend the reach of your posts beyond your Instagram followers. Finding the best hashtags on Instagram is relatively easy since you only have to tap on the Search icon and you’ll be able to see posts with the trending hashtags on the platform.</p><p> A post with just a single hashtag has 12,6% more engagement than an Instagram post that doesn’t have any hashtags.</p><h4 id="4-Post-your-videos-at-peak-times-3"><a href="#4-Post-your-videos-at-peak-times-3" class="headerlink" title="4.  Post your videos at peak times"></a>4.  Post your videos at peak times</h4><p> In life and in social media marketing, timing is everything. Finding the best time to post your video on Instagram isn’t an exact science since different studies have come up with conflicting results. Despite this, the best time to post a video on Instagram is in the afternoon or in the evening when the majority of your followers are at home while posting during the working hours produces underwhelming results.</p><p> What’s more, brands that offer different services have different peak times, so you should use all the means available to you to find the best time to post a video on your Instagram account.</p><h4 id="5-Use-boomerangs-and-Instagram-Stories-3"><a href="#5-Use-boomerangs-and-Instagram-Stories-3" class="headerlink" title="5.  Use boomerangs and Instagram Stories"></a>5.  Use boomerangs and Instagram Stories</h4><p> Since the introduction of Instagram Stories in August 2016, the number of Instagram users has almost doubled, which only shows how popular and important Instagram Stories are. Even though videos featured in Instagram Stories cannot be longer than 15 seconds, they provide more than enough room to create compelling short videos.</p><p> Boomerang feature, is right at the border between a photo and a video which opens up space for experimentation and trying out different approaches to your followers.</p><h4 id="6-Include-a-call-to-action-in-the-comments-to-encourage-the-audience-interaction-3"><a href="#6-Include-a-call-to-action-in-the-comments-to-encourage-the-audience-interaction-3" class="headerlink" title="6.  Include a call to action in the comments to encourage the audience interaction"></a>6.  Include a call to action in the comments to encourage the audience interaction</h4><p> The importance of engaging the audience of your Instagram videos can hardly be stressed enough because even if your videos are worthy of an Oscar they won’t help your business grow if the audience doesn’t take action and buys the products you were showcasing on your Instagram account.</p><p> Including a call to action is the description of a video will spark enthusiasm and inspire the viewer of your Instagram video to post a comment, visit a website or take any other action you want them to.</p><h4 id="7-Repost-your-videos-3"><a href="#7-Repost-your-videos-3" class="headerlink" title="7.  Repost your videos"></a>7.  Repost your videos</h4><p> If your videos on Instagram are not getting as many views as you would like you can try reposting them because it can easily happen that some of the followers simply missed the video you posted.</p><p> Producing and posting fresh content on your Instagram account is important, but every once in a while you should take the time to remind your followers of the great things you’ve already done. Furthermore, every few months you’ll have new followers so reposting a video can be a great way to show them a video they might have missed.</p><h4 id="8-Run-Instagram-video-ads-3"><a href="#8-Run-Instagram-video-ads-3" class="headerlink" title="8.

The app has made it huge in the social media game, with roughly 1 billion official app users and 500 million daily active users of IG stories. By just creating an Instagram account, people may share videos directly from their cell phones. However, because Instagram allows for varied video lengths, figuring out <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >how to post videos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> might be difficult. There is a specific time limit for each video genre. All of those video forms, including Instagram feed and story videos, IG Live and IGTV, Instagram reels, and ad videos, will be covered in this article.</p><p>We’ll start by discussing what we mean by “Instagram video.” Instagram video encompasses the Instagram feed, Instagram Stories, Instagram Live, and Instagram advertisements, among other things. Instagram continues to expand at a rapid pace as more consumers and organizations migrate to mobile. Businesses are flocking to Instagram since it has shown to be successful. That’s not all, though as millions of businesses join Instagram, the chances of you running into competition increase. Businesses need to have a presence on Facebook because their customers expect it and search for them there, and the same is true of Instagram.</p><h4 id="In-this-article"><a href="#In-this-article" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 <a href="#part1">How Long Can An Instagram Video Be?</a></p><p>02 <a href="#part2">How Do You Adjust The Duration Of Your Video For Instagram?</a></p><p>03 <a href="#part3">Tutorial for How to Record on GarageBand</a></p><h2 id="How-Long-Can-An-Instagram-Video-Be"><a href="#How-Long-Can-An-Instagram-Video-Be" class="headerlink" title="How Long Can An Instagram Video Be?"></a>How Long Can An Instagram Video Be?</h2><p>Instagram feed videos, Instagram Story videos, IGTV videos, Instagram advertising, and Instagram Live have various length limitations. We’ve broken down Instagram video length details for each of them in this guide.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/instagram-video-length-1.png"                      alt="instagram video length"                ></p><h4 id="Instagram-Story-Video"><a href="#Instagram-Story-Video" class="headerlink" title="Instagram Story Video"></a>Instagram Story Video</h4><p>Instagram Stories are full-screen, vertical photographs and videos that vanish after 24 hours. Rather than appearing in the news feed, they appear at the top of the Instagram app. To make your material stand out, they use interactive features like stickers, polls, and Instagram Story filters.</p><p>Each Instagram Story has a length of 15-second time limit. If you upload a video that is longer than 15 seconds, they will automatically cut it into 15-second segments. However, based on testing, it appears that you’ll only receive four 15-second parts. Thus, this is only suitable for recordings under one minute.</p><p>Furthermore, to use the new feature and make lengthier Instagram Stories, simply tap the Your Story symbol and then press and hold the record button in the bottom-right corner for as long as you want to record a moment - without worrying about the 15-second limit.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/instagram-video-length-2.png"                      alt="instgarm story video length"                ></p><h4 id="Instagram-Reels"><a href="#Instagram-Reels" class="headerlink" title="Instagram Reels"></a>Instagram Reels</h4><p>Instagram’s newest feature is Reels. It also allows you to share small video snippets (up to 15 seconds in length) with all Instagram users. Before publishing your Reel, you can dub audio, tweak footage, and add instant effects. The Reel video will then appear in your followers’ feeds.</p><p>Instagram Reels length is now limited to 60 seconds in duration. Previously, the maximum length was 30 seconds, however owing to competition from TikTok, Instagram decided to raise it. TikTok, one of the platform’s main competitors, recently increased the video length limit to three minutes.</p><p>To use this feature, go to Create a New Reel and then press the left-hand down button to see the menu. To construct a reel, tap “length” to choose between settings.</p><h4 id="IGTV-Video-On-Instagram"><a href="#IGTV-Video-On-Instagram" class="headerlink" title="IGTV Video On Instagram"></a>IGTV Video On Instagram</h4><p>Creators can upload high-quality, long-form, vertical videos to Instagram TV, also known as IGTV. Users may use IGTV to generate more engaging content for their audiences. Because social media is all about sharing interesting content, IGTV is worth looking into.</p><p>Instagram’s IGTV section allows users to upload and view longer videos. IGTV videos length is of 15 minutes long on the Instagram mobile app and up to an hour-long on the Instagram website. And because these films are posts, they won’t vanish after a day as Stories do.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/instagram-video-length-3.png"                      alt="IGTV video length"                ></p><h4 id="IG-Feed-Video"><a href="#IG-Feed-Video" class="headerlink" title="IG Feed Video"></a>IG Feed Video</h4><p>The videos you submit to your main Instagram page, rather than your Stories, are referred to as Instagram feed videos. These appear on your followers’ Instagram feeds as well as on your main profile page.</p><p>Videos can only be 1 minute or 60 seconds long when posted to the Instagram feed. In addition, if you wish to submit a video to your Instagram feed or profile, you must keep it under 60 seconds. If you have a longer than a minute video, you must use the app to select a 60-second frame and post it to your feed. You can trim the video and choose your favorite parts utilizing the app’s built-in editor.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/instagram-video-length-4.png"                      alt="IG Feed video length"                ></p><h4 id="IG-Feed-Video-Ads"><a href="#IG-Feed-Video-Ads" class="headerlink" title="IG Feed Video Ads"></a>IG Feed Video Ads</h4><p>The videos you submit to your main Instagram page, rather than your Stories, are referred to as Instagram feed videos. These appear on your followers’ Instagram feeds as well as on your main profile page.</p><p>If you want to share a video on your Instagram feed or profile, you must keep it under 60 seconds. If you have a longer than a minute video, you must use the app to select a 60-second frame and post it to your feed. You can trim the video and choose your favorite parts using the app’s built-in editor. You can then post it immediately to your profile. To do so, go to your profile and click the ‘+’ icon. Choose the video you wish to share and then click ‘next.’ That concludes the discussion. You can now share the movie on your social media accounts with an interesting caption.</p><h4 id="IG-Story-Video-Ads"><a href="#IG-Story-Video-Ads" class="headerlink" title="IG Story Video Ads"></a>IG Story Video Ads</h4><p>Instagram Stories advertisements are an excellent method to reach out to new people while also showcasing your brand, company, and products to an already engaged audience. Instagram Stories already have excellent engagement rates, with one out of every five stories receiving a direct reply from viewers.</p><p>The maximum length of an Instagram Story video ad is two minutes. You can utilize different story cards if you want to show your ad on an Instagram story. Each card can display a 15-second video or a single 5-second picture ad. Only the first three cards of a complete ad will appear in the Instagram story stream. After that, after touching on the ad, the viewer must choose whether or not to see more.</p><p>Furthermore, Instagram Stories will show 15-second or shorter video advertising for the duration of the video. Video ads lasting more than 10 seconds will be broken into different Stories cards.</p><h2 id="How-Do-You-Adjust-The-Duration-Of-Your-Video-For-Instagram"><a href="#How-Do-You-Adjust-The-Duration-Of-Your-Video-For-Instagram" class="headerlink" title="How Do You Adjust The Duration Of Your Video For Instagram?"></a>How Do You Adjust The Duration Of Your Video For Instagram?</h2><p>You must be thinking about how to upload flawlessly every time with all of these time limits and video publication options. Here are some helpful hints:</p><ul><li>If you’re worried your IG Feed video is too long and don’t want to edit it, make a video carousel post by breaking it up into smaller chunks. By swiping the post, the viewer will be able to see everything.</li><li>If you felt pressed to stay inside the time limit and made a video that was far too short, you can add more footage, slow it down, or add a loop. Another option is to use a video editor to make an intro and an end screen.</li><li>If your Instagram story is too long, you can cut it down using any Instagram video editor. Record the video, then open it in your app to edit and trim it down before selecting the clips to upload the full story.</li><li>In addition, if your Instagram ad video is longer than 15 seconds, Instagram provides 10 cards, each with a 15-second video duration limit. This will allow you to show your complete advertisement without compressing it.</li><li>The four-hour limit seems insufficient if you wish to have a more extended live stream on Instagram. Then, as soon as you reach the time restriction, you can easily go live again and re-start the stream as many times as you wish.</li><li>To make videos that will receive hundreds of likes on Instagram, you’ll need video editing software that allows you to change the aspect ratio of the videos you wish to submit. Wondershare Filmora is a video editing program that supports a wide range of video file formats and allows you to crop and prepare your videos for web use.</li></ul><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For Win 7 or later (64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For macOS 10.12 or later</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p><strong>●</strong> That’s all there is to know about the length of Instagram videos.

Choose the video you wish to share and then click ‘next.’ That concludes the discussion. You can now share the movie on your social media accounts with an interesting caption.</p><h4 id="IG-Story-Video-Ads-3"><a href="#IG-Story-Video-Ads-3" class="headerlink" title="IG Story Video Ads"></a>IG Story Video Ads</h4><p>Instagram Stories advertisements are an excellent method to reach out to new people while also showcasing your brand, company, and products to an already engaged audience. Instagram Stories already have excellent engagement rates, with one out of every five stories receiving a direct reply from viewers.</p><p>The maximum length of an Instagram Story video ad is two minutes. You can utilize different story cards if you want to show your ad on an Instagram story. Each card can display a 15-second video or a single 5-second picture ad. Only the first three cards of a complete ad will appear in the Instagram story stream. After that, after touching on the ad, the viewer must choose whether or not to see more.</p><p>Furthermore, Instagram Stories will show 15-second or shorter video advertising for the duration of the video. Video ads lasting more than 10 seconds will be broken into different Stories cards.</p><h2 id="How-Do-You-Adjust-The-Duration-Of-Your-Video-For-Instagram-3"><a href="#How-Do-You-Adjust-The-Duration-Of-Your-Video-For-Instagram-3" class="headerlink" title="How Do You Adjust The Duration Of Your Video For Instagram?"></a>How Do You Adjust The Duration Of Your Video For Instagram?</h2><p>You must be thinking about how to upload flawlessly every time with all of these time limits and video publication options. Here are some helpful hints:</p><ul><li>If you’re worried your IG Feed video is too long and don’t want to edit it, make a video carousel post by breaking it up into smaller chunks. By swiping the post, the viewer will be able to see everything.</li><li>If you felt pressed to stay inside the time limit and made a video that was far too short, you can add more footage, slow it down, or add a loop. Another option is to use a video editor to make an intro and an end screen.</li><li>If your Instagram story is too long, you can cut it down using any Instagram video editor. Record the video, then open it in your app to edit and trim it down before selecting the clips to upload the full story.</li><li>In addition, if your Instagram ad video is longer than 15 seconds, Instagram provides 10 cards, each with a 15-second video duration limit. This will allow you to show your complete advertisement without compressing it.</li><li>The four-hour limit seems insufficient if you wish to have a more extended live stream on Instagram. Then, as soon as you reach the time restriction, you can easily go live again and re-start the stream as many times as you wish.</li><li>To make videos that will receive hundreds of likes on Instagram, you’ll need video editing software that allows you to change the aspect ratio of the videos you wish to submit. Wondershare Filmora is a video editing program that supports a wide range of video file formats and allows you to crop and prepare your videos for web use.</li></ul><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For Win 7 or later (64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For macOS 10.12 or later</p><h2 id="Conclusion-3"><a href="#Conclusion-3" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p><strong>●</strong> That’s all there is to know about the length of Instagram videos. Isn’t it simple? Take the advice above, make your videos as long as possible, and post when your followers are online, and your post engagement and follower count will skyrocket.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"

Sometimes we need to accelerate the video to make it more engaging while also saving the viewer’s time. Because Instagram stories and posts have a limited length, we must speed up videos and present them as much as possible in a short amount of time.</p><p>However, most people don’t know <strong>How to Speed Up Video on Instagram</strong>, and if you’re one of them, don’t worry. This article covers an easy method to speed up the video on smartphones and computers and some online tools to assist you. Let’s get started.</p><h4 id="In-this-article"><a href="#In-this-article" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 <a href="#part1">How to Speed up Video for Instagram on iPhone with Hyperlapse?</a></p><p>02 <a href="#part2">How to Speed up Video for Instagram on Android with Filmora?</a></p><p>03 <a href="#part3">How to Speed up Video for Instagram Online for Free?</a></p><p>04 <a href="#part4">How to Speed up Video for Instagram on Computer Desktop?</a></p><p>05 <a href="#part5">How to Upload Video from Desktop to Instagram</a></p><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Speed-up-Video-for-Instagram-on-iPhone-with-Hyperlapse"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Speed-up-Video-for-Instagram-on-iPhone-with-Hyperlapse" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to Speed up Video for Instagram on iPhone with Hyperlapse?"></a>Part 1: How to Speed up Video for Instagram on iPhone with Hyperlapse?</h2><p>When speeding up Instagram videos, Hyperlapse is unquestionably the most acceptable option for iPhone users. A supplementary app (Hyperlapse) for Instagram is specifically developed to allow users to accelerate Instagram video speed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/hyperlapse-from-instagram.jpg"                      alt="hyperlapse from instagram"                ></p><p>You have the option of uploading a video from your iPhone or shooting a movie from inside the application. By default, your video is being played at a speed of 6X. This software, however, also has several drawbacks. For example, it can only assist you in increasing the pace of the videos. There are no editing features.</p><p>To know how to speed up a video for Instagram using Hyperlapse, follow these steps:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Launch Hyperlapse on your iPhone, press the <strong>record</strong> button. Stop filming anytime you wish and keep your hands motionless.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> You’ll see a speedometer now. The default speed is <strong>6X</strong>, but you may lower it to <strong>1X</strong> or boost it to <strong>12X</strong> if you choose. Move to the right to speed up the video.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Right after you’ve chosen your desired speed, click “OK.” If you want to share the video, you may do so on social media platforms like Instagram and Facebook.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Speed-up-Video-for-Instagram-on-Android-with-Filmora"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Speed-up-Video-for-Instagram-on-Android-with-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Speed up Video for Instagram on Android with Filmora?"></a>Part 2: How to Speed up Video for Instagram on Android with Filmora?</h2><p>On Android, you do not have access to the Hyperlapse application. Hence, you will need Filmora from the Google Play store. It’s one of the most well-regarded video editing tools available.</p><p>This application allows you to convert any video into a slow or fast motion video with no effort. The most attractive feature of this tool is that it allows you to speed up different segments from a single video simultaneously. However, you can only increase the video speed by a factor of two at the most.</p><p>To know how to speed up existing video for Instagram with Filmora, follow these steps:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Touch New Project to begin a new filming session at the bottom of the screen.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Choose the video you want to speed up and hit <strong>Import</strong>.

The most attractive feature of this tool is that it allows you to speed up different segments from a single video simultaneously.

Instagram actually allows up to 30 hashtags, but if you use between 4 and 10 hashtags, you’re going to get the most engagement possible. If you go past that, it won’t make a difference.</p><p>Also, always look at popular and banned hashtag lists.

Instagram actually allows up to 30 hashtags, but if you use between 4 and 10 hashtags, you’re going to get the most engagement possible. If you go past that, it won’t make a difference.</p><p>Also, always look at popular and banned hashtag lists. Popular hashtags will get more clicks; but if you used a banned hashtag, your post won’t show up in any hashtags. It’s all about balance.</p><p>Hashtags are a great way to get people to see your content and to be interested in what you’re doing on your website. If you learn the art of the hashtag and you start using it on your Instagram content, you will start to see a lot more engagement and sharing, which can help your audience to expand.</p><p>If you don’t know how to upload pictures and video Instagram posts, check this Ultimate Guide on <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Instagram Video Dimensions &amp; Story Size for a perfect post <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to drive millions of followers.</p><h2 id="Create-Gorgeous-Instagram-Videos-with-Full-Featured-Video-Editor-3"><a href="#Create-Gorgeous-Instagram-Videos-with-Full-Featured-Video-Editor-3" class="headerlink" title="Create Gorgeous Instagram Videos with Full-Featured Video Editor"></a>Create Gorgeous Instagram Videos with Full-Featured Video Editor</h2><p>Besides photos, video content is as popular as picture content on Instagram.

Firstly, click on the <strong>Stories</strong> camera tab, and on the bottom, swipe to click on <strong>Reels</strong>. Secondly, tap on the <strong>plus</strong> <strong>sign</strong> on the home screen. Or, go to the <strong>Reels</strong> tab and click on the <strong>camera</strong> <strong>icon</strong> in the top right corner.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/instagram-reels-tab.jpg"                      alt="Instagram Reels Tab"                ></p><p>2.Now, you edit the settings before you record or upload footage.</p><ul><li><strong>Audio</strong>- Choose a huge music library. You can trim to add your favorite part. Click on any song to use for your video clip.</li><li><strong>Speed</strong>- You can speed up or add a slow-mo effect to videos by selecting a speed.</li><li><strong>Effects</strong>- There are multiple effects and filters to make the videos catchy and trendy.</li><li><strong>Timer</strong>- Set a time limit for your videos. The video will automatically stop recording after the specified time.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/instagram-reels-trimer.jpg"                      alt="Instagram Reels Trimer"                ></p><p>3.You can then press on the <strong>recording</strong> <strong>icon</strong> to shoot the video or select an already existing footage from the camera roll.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/instagram-reels-recording-button.jpg"                      alt="Instagram Reels Recording Button"                ></p><p>4.You can tap and record multiple clips seamlessly by clicking on the <strong>Align</strong> icon, which appears after one clip is recorded.</p><p>5.Finally, add text or stickers to your Instagram reels.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-sticker-to-reels.jpg"                      alt="Add Sticker To Reels"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-Instagram-Reels-VS-TikTok"><a href="#Part-4-Instagram-Reels-VS-TikTok" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Instagram Reels VS TikTok"></a>Part 4: Instagram Reels VS TikTok</h2><p>Much like TikTok, Instagram reels are reserved for creating short and engaging videos. Instagram reels can be browsed from the Explore tab. And similarly, TikTok videos can be browsed from the For You tab. One major similarity between these two is the editing feature. There are various tools in both TikTok and Instagram reels that enable users to make their videos unique and entertaining.</p><p>Instagram reels are said to be inspired by TikTok but it has many differences that set it apart. Such as the video clip length for Instagram reels is reserved to 15 seconds, whereas TikTok videos can be up to 1 minute long. The biggest difference is that TikTok is an app dedicated to short videos and Instagram reels is a feature inside the parent Instagram app. TikTok allows the option of creating duets, but Instagram reels lack this option limiting user creativity. Even though both Instagram reels and TikTok have the option to add audio, Instagram reels don’t allow the addition of an original song. On the other hand, local music files can be easily uploaded for use on TikTok. Videos on TikTok do not disappear. However, Instagram reels uploaded as stories vanish after 24 hours and are not saved anywhere.</p><h3 id="Ready-to-try-Instagram-Reels"><a href="#Ready-to-try-Instagram-Reels" class="headerlink" title="Ready to try Instagram Reels?"></a>Ready to try Instagram Reels?</h3><p>Instagram reels have brought users a great opportunity of creating short yet influential videos right in the app. The ease and convenience of creating and editing videos is the reason behind its success</p><p>And, now you know all there is to know about Instagram reels. It is about time that you jump on this bandwagon and scale up your business or simply make your profile more appealing. Surprise your friends and family by creating highly engaging videos that are fun to watch. Captivate the audience with compelling content. Express yourself fully but creatively with Instagram reels and explore the reels created by others.

Many influencers think if they have more followers, they will have more opportunities to cooperate with brands, so they tend to buy fake Instagram followers.</p><p> However, brands like to work with influencers having <a class="link"   href="https://buffer.com/resources/micro-influencers" >high engagement rate <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> nowadays, instead of influencers with huge follower base.

But, there are a few who use genuine information of other real users, without their knowledge to prove themselves legitimate.</p><p> The fake Instagram followers often use fake bios and stolen photos, making it very difficult for the outside companies to spot the real between so many fakes. The problem has become worse with social media influencers seeking fake followers in order to enhance their online presence.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Check-Fake-Instagram-Followers"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Check-Fake-Instagram-Followers" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Check Fake Instagram Followers"></a>Part 3: How to Check Fake Instagram Followers</h2><p> You can always find out if an Instagram account is fake. Check these free tips below.</p><h3 id="1-Check-Followers"><a href="#1-Check-Followers" class="headerlink" title="1. Check Followers"></a>1. Check Followers</h3><p> While searching for a brand influencer and targeting a few, <a class="link"   href="https://www.jeffbullas.com/how-to-check-if-an-influencer-is-influential/" >go through the profile of each influencer <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to check if they have any fake followers in their profile. It is not very difficult to understand if the influencer you are targeting has fake followers or not. Wondering how? Check out for the points below to figure out the fake Instagram followers.</p><ul><li>Profiles with no photos must be considered fake. The brands must be cautious if the influencer they have targeted consist of fake followers who usually lack a profile picture in their accounts. Any sort of spammy usernames must also be considered fake.</li><li>Check out for the spam comments – When the influencer’s post gets tons of likes and comments, it is evident that all of their followers are very active. You must go through some of the comments to scan if any comments have no meaning or look gibberish. In case you find one, it is a fake Instagram follower.</li><li>Use of fan buying services – Try to look for the profiles that your influencers are following. If you find any fan buying accounts, you can count it as the fake Instagram followers.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ins-fake-followers.JPG"                      alt="fake followers"                ></p><h3 id="2-Check-Profile-Sections"><a href="#2-Check-Profile-Sections" class="headerlink" title="2. Check Profile Sections"></a>2. Check Profile Sections</h3><p> Usually, the fake Instagram followers do not put much effort into creating an appealing profile, and neither do they have a realistic bio. They might even leave the bio space empty or fill in minimum details.</p><p> Your profile check becomes tough when the fake followers turn their profile settings to hidden. It is obvious that the one who hides their profile, can it be authentic? Can you get a loyal and committed follower with such fake Instagram followers? Such profiles instantly get a red flag.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/check-profile-sections.JPG"                      alt="check profile sections"                ></p><h3 id="3-Check-Engagement"><a href="#3-Check-Engagement" class="headerlink" title="3. Check Engagement"></a>3. Check Engagement</h3><p> The <a class="link"   href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/calculate-engagement-rate/" >engagement rate <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> must be proportional to the number of followers in your influencer’s account. The brands can calculate if the engagement rate is proportionate to the number of followers by comparing the number of comments and likes to the number of followers.</p><p> The Instagram accounts that have several followers but a very low engagement rate are usually considered to have several fake Instagram followers. For calculating the engagement rate of any account, you may pick last uploaded ten photos and take out the average number of comments and likes garnered on those images. Then, divide the average number by several followers and, finally, multiply it by 10. Even if you find the engagement rate satisfying, check out if the comments and likes are real or purchased.</p><h3 id="4-Using-Third-Party-Tools"><a href="#4-Using-Third-Party-Tools" class="headerlink" title="4. Using Third-Party Tools"></a>4. Using Third-Party Tools</h3><p> If you feel that calculating manually is not the best thing to do, you can also find some tools that can help you to determine if the followers of your influencer are fake.</p><h4 id="FollowerCheck"><a href="#FollowerCheck" class="headerlink" title="FollowerCheck"></a>FollowerCheck</h4><p> FollowerCheck is one such tool that scans the influencer’s profile and finds out the results for real versus the fake followers. The most suspicious follower’s names are identified through this tool. It is a free tool that helps you with snapshots of the followers of the account. If a valid account has several fake Instagram followers, then you may block or remove the users. FollowerCheck offers 100% accurate results and works for the large follower bases.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/followercheck.JPG"                      alt="followercheck"                ></p><h4 id="Auditor-for-Instagram"><a href="#Auditor-for-Instagram" class="headerlink" title="Auditor for Instagram"></a>Auditor for Instagram</h4><p> An AI-powered tool, the Auditor for Instagram, offers to help the marketers in checking the Instagram accounts of the Influencers for fake likes and followers. In this mode, machine learning is used to find patterns of behavior.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/auditor-for-instagram.JPG"                      alt="auditor for instagram"                ></p><h3 id="5-Check-Instagram-Follower-Growth"><a href="#5-Check-Instagram-Follower-Growth" class="headerlink" title="5. Check Instagram Follower Growth"></a>5. Check Instagram Follower Growth</h3><p> Normally, the health follower growth is consistent and steady. Overall, the increase is smooth, with a slight drop each day. However, the followers will go spike suddenly and then drop deeply if an Instagram account bought fake followers before. You need to track at least three months of statistics. There are many social media monitor tools in the market like <a class="link"   href="https://socialblade.com/" >Socialblade <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://hootsuite.com/" >Hootsuite <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://buzzsumo.com/" >BuzzSumo <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, and more.

Check Profile Sections</h3><p> Usually, the fake Instagram followers do not put much effort into creating an appealing profile, and neither do they have a realistic bio. They might even leave the bio space empty or fill in minimum details.</p><p> Your profile check becomes tough when the fake followers turn their profile settings to hidden. It is obvious that the one who hides their profile, can it be authentic? Can you get a loyal and committed follower with such fake Instagram followers? Such profiles instantly get a red flag.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/check-profile-sections.JPG"                      alt="check profile sections"                ></p><h3 id="3-Check-Engagement-3"><a href="#3-Check-Engagement-3" class="headerlink" title="3.

The brands can calculate if the engagement rate is proportionate to the number of followers by comparing the number of comments and likes to the number of followers.</p><p> The Instagram accounts that have several followers but a very low engagement rate are usually considered to have several fake Instagram followers. For calculating the engagement rate of any account, you may pick last uploaded ten photos and take out the average number of comments and likes garnered on those images. Then, divide the average number by several followers and, finally, multiply it by 10. Even if you find the engagement rate satisfying, check out if the comments and likes are real or purchased.</p><h3 id="4-Using-Third-Party-Tools-3"><a href="#4-Using-Third-Party-Tools-3" class="headerlink" title="4.

[PC &amp; Mac &amp; iPhone &amp; Android]"></a>Part 1: How to Resize IGTV Videos? [PC &amp; Mac &amp; iPhone &amp; Android]</h2><p>At the moment, IGTV only supports videos with aspect ratios that range from <strong>4:5 to 9:16</strong>, so if you recorded a video in any other aspect ratio you will have to change it before you share it on your IGTV channel. Moreover, the maximum size of a video file that lasts up to ten minutes is limited to just <strong>650MB</strong>, and the chances are that you will have to change the file’s size in order to be able to upload it to IGTV. Let’s have a look at some of the most effective ways of reformatting your IGTV videos.</p><h4 id="Resizing-Videos-with-Filmora-on-Mac-and-PC-Computers"><a href="#Resizing-Videos-with-Filmora-on-Mac-and-PC-Computers" class="headerlink" title="Resizing Videos with Filmora on Mac and PC Computers"></a>Resizing Videos with Filmora on Mac and PC Computers</h4><p>Changing the aspect ratio and the resolution of a video file in Filmora is easy. After you launch Wondershare’s video editor, you’ll have the option to <strong>create a new project</strong> or continue working on a project you already created. Once Filmora’s main window appears on the screen you just have to go to the <strong>File menu</strong> and select the <strong>Project Settings option</strong>.</p><p>You can then change the resolution or choose a different frame rate. It is best to pick the <strong>1080X1920 (9:16 Portrait) option</strong> since the files exported in 2160X3840 (9:16 Portrait) resolution can end up being too large for the IGTV platform. Click on the OK button to confirm the adjustments you’ve made, and proceed to edit your video.</p><p>In case the process of changing a video’s aspect ratio and resolution is too complicated for you, Filmora offers an even simpler way of reformatting footage. Simply <strong>import a video</strong> into the video editor, and then <strong>place it on a video track on the timeline</strong>. <strong>Right-click on the file</strong> and select the <strong>Crop and Zoom option</strong> from the menu, or alternatively, just use the left mouse click to select a video you added to the timeline and use the <strong>Alt+C keyboard shortcut</strong> to access the <strong>Crop and Zoom window</strong>.</p><p>Click on the <strong>Ratio drop-down menu</strong> and choose the <strong>9:16 option</strong>, and then <strong>position the Crop rectangle over the area of the video you’d like to keep</strong>. Clicking on the <strong>Ok button</strong> will remove all the parts of the video that were outside of the area covered by the Crop rectangle, and you can then click on the <strong>Play button</strong> below the <strong>Preview Window</strong> to see the results before you export the video.</p><p>Here is a video tutorial for you to learn how to resize the video with Filmora.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                > </a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                > </a></p><h4 id="Using-Kapwing-to-Resize-Videos-Online"><a href="#Using-Kapwing-to-Resize-Videos-Online" class="headerlink" title="Using Kapwing to Resize Videos Online"></a>Using Kapwing to Resize Videos Online</h4><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.kapwing.com/" >Kapwing <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is an online video editing platform that offers a number of useful tools that enable its users to quickly polish their videos before posting them on social media. Upon arriving at Kapwing’s home page you will be able to see a number of different options, such as <strong>Video Maker, Rotate Video, Filter Video, or Video Speed</strong>, so you just have to click on the <strong>Resize video</strong> tool to start changing the aspect ratio and the resolution of your video.</p><p>A new window will open in your browser after you click on the Resize video feature, and you will be asked to <strong>upload a file</strong> from your computer or to <strong>paste a video’s URL</strong>. Once you upload a video to the Kapwing platform you can choose from <strong>Instagram, Story or IGTV, YouTube, FB&#x2F;Twitter Portrait, FB&#x2F;Twitter Landscape, or Facebook Cover</strong> options. Click on the <strong>Story or IGTV setting</strong>, choose between <strong>No Crop and Crop</strong> presets, and select the <strong>background color</strong> before hitting the <strong>Create button</strong>.</p><p>After the platform processes the video, you’ll be able to download it to your computer or continue editing it. The only downside is that all of your IGTV videos are going to be watermarked if you’re using the free version of the platform.</p><h4 id="Resizing-Vertical-Videos-with-iMovie-on-macOS"><a href="#Resizing-Vertical-Videos-with-iMovie-on-macOS" class="headerlink" title="Resizing Vertical Videos with iMovie on macOS"></a>Resizing Vertical Videos with iMovie on macOS</h4><p>Even though iMovie allows its users to change a video’s aspect ratio, this video editor for Mac computers only lets you choose between standard <strong>16:9 and 4:3 aspect ratios</strong>. That’s the reason why the only way to get your videos ready for IGTV in iMovie is to crop them.</p><p>Simply click on the <strong>Crop icon</strong> in the editor’s toolbar and then use the <strong>crop rectangle</strong> to create a vertically oriented video. Use the Preview Window to make sure that you are satisfied with the results and proceed to export it from iMovie.</p><h4 id="Using-the-Video-Resizer-for-IGTV-Frame-app-on-iPhones"><a href="#Using-the-Video-Resizer-for-IGTV-Frame-app-on-iPhones" class="headerlink" title="Using the Video Resizer for IGTV&amp;Frame app on iPhones"></a>Using the Video Resizer for IGTV&amp;Frame app on iPhones</h4><p>Creators who frequently record their IGTV videos with their iPhones, don’t necessarily have to use desktop-based video editors, because apps like <a class="link"   href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/video-resizer-for-igtv-frame/id1379007244?mt=8" >Video Resizer for IGTV&amp;Frame Resizing IGTV <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> make optimizing footage for IGTV quick and easy.</p><p>The app offers a wide range of resizing options, and you can <strong>match width or height</strong>, add a <strong>border around a video</strong> or even <strong>move the video</strong> in any way you want. The best part is that <strong>preset video file sizes for Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter videos are available within the app</strong>, so you can quickly resize a video before uploading it to IGTV. Even though you can use this app for free, you must upgrade to the Pro version in order to use all the features it has to offer.</p><h4 id="Videos-with-Smart-Video-Rotate-and-Flip-–-Rotator-and-Flipper-app-on-Android-Devices"><a href="#Videos-with-Smart-Video-Rotate-and-Flip-–-Rotator-and-Flipper-app-on-Android-Devices" class="headerlink" title="Videos with Smart Video Rotate and Flip – Rotator and Flipper app on Android Devices"></a>Videos with Smart Video Rotate and Flip – Rotator and Flipper app on Android Devices</h4><p>Unfortunately, there isn’t much more you can do with this app other than <strong>flip or rotate videos</strong>. Changing the aspect ratio is not an option <a class="link"   href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.clogica.videorotator&hl=en_US" >Smart Video Rotate and Flip – Rotator and Flipper app <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> offer and you can’t use the app to crop your videos. The results you’ll be able to get by rotating a landscape video can be underwhelming, so this app can only be helpful for IGTV creators if the footage you’re rotating is captured in a 16:9 aspect ratio since you can then turn it to 9:16 by simply rotating it.</p><h4 id="Part-2-A-Few-Tips-for-Shooting-Better-IGTV-Videos"><a href="#Part-2-A-Few-Tips-for-Shooting-Better-IGTV-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: A Few Tips for Shooting Better IGTV Videos"></a>Part 2: A Few Tips for Shooting Better IGTV Videos</h4><p>Recording the footage with your Smartphone is perhaps the quickest way to create an IGTV video since you can just hold your phone vertically while recording is in progress. There are lots of video editing apps you can use to enhance the colors, add hardcoded subtitles or visual effects to each video you want to upload to your IGTV channel.</p><p>Until recently recording vertical videos with video cameras was one of the biggest mistakes you could make, but platforms like IGTV have changed that. So, if you would like to capture your IGTV videos with professional cameras and lenses, all you have to do is rotate the camera for 90-degrees. You can also record horizontally oriented videos and then rotate them to change their aspect ratio in video editing software like Filmora.</p><h4 id="Part-3-Tips-for-Resizing-IGTV-Videos"><a href="#Part-3-Tips-for-Resizing-IGTV-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Tips for Resizing IGTV Videos"></a>Part 3: Tips for Resizing IGTV Videos</h4><p>Resizing a video or changing its aspect ratio is a fairly simple process, but if you want to post videos on IGTV it is better if you record all of your content in accordance with the platform’s demands. The shot composition is an important aspect of creating an IGTV video since if your framing isn’t perfect you may end up removing parts of your footage. Despite the fact that IGTV lets you upload videos that last up to ten minutes, posting shorter videos that last two or three minutes will produce better results, as most social media users have a short attention span.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>You don’t have to be a skilled video editor in order to <strong>resize a video</strong>, because most video editing software products offer a lot of easy ways to accomplish this. In addition, you don’t even have to edit your videos from a computer, because there are a lot of Android and iOS-based apps that enable you to rotate or reformat your IGTV videos in just a few easy taps.

Clicking on the <strong>Ok button</strong> will remove all the parts of the video that were outside of the area covered by the Crop rectangle, and you can then click on the <strong>Play button</strong> below the <strong>Preview Window</strong> to see the results before you export the video.</p><p>Here is a video tutorial for you to learn how to resize the video with Filmora.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                > </a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                > </a></p><h4 id="Using-Kapwing-to-Resize-Videos-Online-3"><a href="#Using-Kapwing-to-Resize-Videos-Online-3" class="headerlink" title="Using Kapwing to Resize Videos Online"></a>Using Kapwing to Resize Videos Online</h4><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.kapwing.com/" >Kapwing <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is an online video editing platform that offers a number of useful tools that enable its users to quickly polish their videos before posting them on social media. Upon arriving at Kapwing’s home page you will be able to see a number of different options, such as <strong>Video Maker, Rotate Video, Filter Video, or Video Speed</strong>, so you just have to click on the <strong>Resize video</strong> tool to start changing the aspect ratio and the resolution of your video.</p><p>A new window will open in your browser after you click on the Resize video feature, and you will be asked to <strong>upload a file</strong> from your computer or to <strong>paste a video’s URL</strong>. Once you upload a video to the Kapwing platform you can choose from <strong>Instagram, Story or IGTV, YouTube, FB&#x2F;Twitter Portrait, FB&#x2F;Twitter Landscape, or Facebook Cover</strong> options. Click on the <strong>Story or IGTV setting</strong>, choose between <strong>No Crop and Crop</strong> presets, and select the <strong>background color</strong> before hitting the <strong>Create button</strong>.</p><p>After the platform processes the video, you’ll be able to download it to your computer or continue editing it. The only downside is that all of your IGTV videos are going to be watermarked if you’re using the free version of the platform.</p><h4 id="Resizing-Vertical-Videos-with-iMovie-on-macOS-3"><a href="#Resizing-Vertical-Videos-with-iMovie-on-macOS-3" class="headerlink" title="Resizing Vertical Videos with iMovie on macOS"></a>Resizing Vertical Videos with iMovie on macOS</h4><p>Even though iMovie allows its users to change a video’s aspect ratio, this video editor for Mac computers only lets you choose between standard <strong>16:9 and 4:3 aspect ratios</strong>. That’s the reason why the only way to get your videos ready for IGTV in iMovie is to crop them.</p><p>Simply click on the <strong>Crop icon</strong> in the editor’s toolbar and then use the <strong>crop rectangle</strong> to create a vertically oriented video. Use the Preview Window to make sure that you are satisfied with the results and proceed to export it from iMovie.</p><h4 id="Using-the-Video-Resizer-for-IGTV-Frame-app-on-iPhones-3"><a href="#Using-the-Video-Resizer-for-IGTV-Frame-app-on-iPhones-3" class="headerlink" title="Using the Video Resizer for IGTV&amp;Frame app on iPhones"></a>Using the Video Resizer for IGTV&amp;Frame app on iPhones</h4><p>Creators who frequently record their IGTV videos with their iPhones, don’t necessarily have to use desktop-based video editors, because apps like <a class="link"   href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/video-resizer-for-igtv-frame/id1379007244?mt=8" >Video Resizer for IGTV&amp;Frame Resizing IGTV <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> make optimizing footage for IGTV quick and easy.</p><p>The app offers a wide range of resizing options, and you can <strong>match width or height</strong>, add a <strong>border around a video</strong> or even <strong>move the video</strong> in any way you want. The best part is that <strong>preset video file sizes for Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter videos are available within the app</strong>, so you can quickly resize a video before uploading it to IGTV. Even though you can use this app for free, you must upgrade to the Pro version in order to use all the features it has to offer.</p><h4 id="Videos-with-Smart-Video-Rotate-and-Flip-–-Rotator-and-Flipper-app-on-Android-Devices-3"><a href="#Videos-with-Smart-Video-Rotate-and-Flip-–-Rotator-and-Flipper-app-on-Android-Devices-3" class="headerlink" title="Videos with Smart Video Rotate and Flip – Rotator and Flipper app on Android Devices"></a>Videos with Smart Video Rotate and Flip – Rotator and Flipper app on Android Devices</h4><p>Unfortunately, there isn’t much more you can do with this app other than <strong>flip or rotate videos</strong>. Changing the aspect ratio is not an option <a class="link"   href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.clogica.videorotator&hl=en_US" >Smart Video Rotate and Flip – Rotator and Flipper app <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> offer and you can’t use the app to crop your videos. The results you’ll be able to get by rotating a landscape video can be underwhelming, so this app can only be helpful for IGTV creators if the footage you’re rotating is captured in a 16:9 aspect ratio since you can then turn it to 9:16 by simply rotating it.</p><h4 id="Part-2-A-Few-Tips-for-Shooting-Better-IGTV-Videos-3"><a href="#Part-2-A-Few-Tips-for-Shooting-Better-IGTV-Videos-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: A Few Tips for Shooting Better IGTV Videos"></a>Part 2: A Few Tips for Shooting Better IGTV Videos</h4><p>Recording the footage with your Smartphone is perhaps the quickest way to create an IGTV video since you can just hold your phone vertically while recording is in progress. There are lots of video editing apps you can use to enhance the colors, add hardcoded subtitles or visual effects to each video you want to upload to your IGTV channel.</p><p>Until recently recording vertical videos with video cameras was one of the biggest mistakes you could make, but platforms like IGTV have changed that. So, if you would like to capture your IGTV videos with professional cameras and lenses, all you have to do is rotate the camera for 90-degrees. You can also record horizontally oriented videos and then rotate them to change their aspect ratio in video editing software like Filmora.</p><h4 id="Part-3-Tips-for-Resizing-IGTV-Videos-3"><a href="#Part-3-Tips-for-Resizing-IGTV-Videos-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Tips for Resizing IGTV Videos"></a>Part 3: Tips for Resizing IGTV Videos</h4><p>Resizing a video or changing its aspect ratio is a fairly simple process, but if you want to post videos on IGTV it is better if you record all of your content in accordance with the platform’s demands. The shot composition is an important aspect of creating an IGTV video since if your framing isn’t perfect you may end up removing parts of your footage. Despite the fact that IGTV lets you upload videos that last up to ten minutes, posting shorter videos that last two or three minutes will produce better results, as most social media users have a short attention span.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>You don’t have to be a skilled video editor in order to <strong>resize a video</strong>, because most video editing software products offer a lot of easy ways to accomplish this. In addition, you don’t even have to edit your videos from a computer, because there are a lot of Android and iOS-based apps that enable you to rotate or reformat your IGTV videos in just a few easy taps.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Uncover-Recent-Instagram-Unfollow-Patterns"><a href="#Uncover-Recent-Instagram-Unfollow-Patterns" class="headerlink" title="Uncover Recent Instagram Unfollow Patterns "></a>Uncover Recent Instagram Unfollow Patterns <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/who-unfollowed-me-on-instagram-poster.png"                      alt="who-unfollowed-me-on-instagram-poster"                ></h2><p>In this article, I am going to discuss how you one can know who unfollowed me on Instagram. Does Instagram have a feature that allows users to know who unfollowed me on Instagram? Is this true? There is a method to do it! To find out, you’ll have to download an app.</p><p>More likes and followers are the two things that every Instagram influencer strives for. However, maintaining your present audience is just as critical. You could be thinking, Who unfollowed me on Instagram? as a result of this experience. As a result, you can know who unfollowed me on Instagram?</p><p>There is no official method to see who has unfollowed you on Instagram. As a result, even if the number of Followers on YOUR profile drops, you will have no idea who unfollowed you.</p><p>There are several third-party Instagram unfollower tracker applications available right now. These are followers and unfollowers trackers for Instagram, so you can observe who no longer finds your posts interesting.</p><h2 id="Third-Party-Instagram-Apps-The-Problem"><a href="#Third-Party-Instagram-Apps-The-Problem" class="headerlink" title="Third-Party Instagram Apps: The Problem"></a>Third-Party Instagram Apps: The Problem</h2><p>While these applications make it simple to see who unfollowed me on Instagram? but they also have a number of drawbacks that should be considered before using them. What can be done by unauthorized developers is heavily limited by Instagram’s API.</p><p>For example, with all these applications, you’ll only view data going back to when you originally installed the program. Every update to your accounts is tracked from the moment you set it up. However, if you lost any followers before downloading the program, you will not recover them.</p><h2 id="FollowMeter-The-Easiest-Best-App-for-Social-Media"><a href="#FollowMeter-The-Easiest-Best-App-for-Social-Media" class="headerlink" title="FollowMeter: The Easiest &amp; Best App for Social Media "></a>FollowMeter: The Easiest &amp; Best App for Social Media <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/followmeter-poster.png"                      alt="followmeter-poster"                ></h2><p>Our favorite program for finding out who stopped following us was FollowMeter, which we tested out a number of times. Setting it up is simple, the user interface is straightforward, and the Unfollower option is absolutely free of charge. Because it only works after setup, you won’t be able to see who has unfollowed you in the past.</p><p>Users may see who has unfollowed them, who has followed them, who has followed you but has not followed them back, and who has followed you but has not returned the favor. To see who unfollowed me on Instagram?, go to the Unfollowers tab and choose All.</p><h2 id="Apps-for-“Who-unfollowed-me-on-Instagram-”-Research"><a href="#Apps-for-“Who-unfollowed-me-on-Instagram-”-Research" class="headerlink" title="Apps for “Who unfollowed me on Instagram?” Research"></a>Apps for “Who unfollowed me on Instagram?” Research</h2><p>Our research also included various free Instagram unfollowed applications other than Followmeter. Here’s a short rundown of the very successful ones: To be on the safe side, we suggest using FollowMeter since the API and regulations for Instagram are always changing.</p><ul><li>Users and Unfollowers on Android: A Comparison (Free)</li><li>Android Followers+ (Free)</li><li>App for iOS: Followers Tracker Pro (Free)</li><li>Instagram Followers Tracker for iOS (Free)</li></ul><h2 id="How-to-Stop-Being-Unfollowed-by-People-You-Used-to-Be"><a href="#How-to-Stop-Being-Unfollowed-by-People-You-Used-to-Be" class="headerlink" title="How to Stop Being Unfollowed by People You Used to Be"></a>How to Stop Being Unfollowed by People You Used to Be</h2><p>“Following back” is significant to some social media users because they want to be remembered. As a result, you may wish to follow back those who unfollowed me on Instagram. To stop receiving notifications from an account, unfollow it.</p><p>However, what about individuals who were already doing this before downloading the app? FollowMeter also lets you see who hasn’t followed you back, so you can go ahead and unfollow them.</p><ul><li>Utilize your Instagram account to log in to FollowMeter.</li><li>Tap Unfollowers on the Home page to unfollow people who are following you.</li><li>Go through the accounts you’ve been following and unfollow them one by one by tapping on their names in the list.</li></ul><p>When you make modifications, your Instagram account automatically updates to reflect those changes.</p><h2 id="Ways-to-Prevent-Losing-Instagram-Followers"><a href="#Ways-to-Prevent-Losing-Instagram-Followers" class="headerlink" title="Ways to Prevent Losing Instagram Followers"></a>Ways to Prevent Losing Instagram Followers</h2><p>Unfollowing you on Instagram might be for various reasons, one of which is because you followed them back.

Here’s a short rundown of the very successful ones: To be on the safe side, we suggest using FollowMeter since the API and regulations for Instagram are always changing.</p><ul><li>Users and Unfollowers on Android: A Comparison (Free)</li><li>Android Followers+ (Free)</li><li>App for iOS: Followers Tracker Pro (Free)</li><li>Instagram Followers Tracker for iOS (Free)</li></ul><h2 id="How-to-Stop-Being-Unfollowed-by-People-You-Used-to-Be-3"><a href="#How-to-Stop-Being-Unfollowed-by-People-You-Used-to-Be-3" class="headerlink" title="How to Stop Being Unfollowed by People You Used to Be"></a>How to Stop Being Unfollowed by People You Used to Be</h2><p>“Following back” is significant to some social media users because they want to be remembered. As a result, you may wish to follow back those who unfollowed me on Instagram. To stop receiving notifications from an account, unfollow it.</p><p>However, what about individuals who were already doing this before downloading the app? FollowMeter also lets you see who hasn’t followed you back, so you can go ahead and unfollow them.</p><ul><li>Utilize your Instagram account to log in to FollowMeter.</li><li>Tap Unfollowers on the Home page to unfollow people who are following you.</li><li>Go through the accounts you’ve been following and unfollow them one by one by tapping on their names in the list.</li></ul><p>When you make modifications, your Instagram account automatically updates to reflect those changes.</p><h2 id="Ways-to-Prevent-Losing-Instagram-Followers-3"><a href="#Ways-to-Prevent-Losing-Instagram-Followers-3" class="headerlink" title="Ways to Prevent Losing Instagram Followers"></a>Ways to Prevent Losing Instagram Followers</h2><p>Unfollowing you on Instagram might be for various reasons, one of which is because you followed them back. You are likely losing Instagram followers for more causes other than the one listed above.</p><h3 id="1-You’ve-Paid-for-followers-3"><a href="#1-You’ve-Paid-for-followers-3" class="headerlink" title="1.You’ve Paid for followers "></a>1.You’ve Paid for followers <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/buy-followers-price.png"                      alt="buy-followers-price"                ></h3><p>Did you pay someone to get you tens of thousands or millions of Instagram followers for several bucks? This kind of manipulation, which typically involves a slew of bots and fake accounts, is frowned upon by Instagram.</p><p>Their follower count may have decreased since Instagram constantly deletes suspicious profiles. These services are indeed a waste of time and money and then have the potential to damage your reputation.</p><p>However, we got an article introducing this service further. <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Check out here&gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h3 id="2-Be-Aware-That-Your-Account-Has-Been-Blacklisted-3"><a href="#2-Be-Aware-That-Your-Account-Has-Been-Blacklisted-3" class="headerlink" title="2.Be Aware That Your Account Has Been Blacklisted "></a>2.Be Aware That Your Account Has Been Blacklisted <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/way2-blacklisted.png"                      alt="way2-blacklisted"                ></h3><p>A “shadow ban” may be imposed if you attempt to manipulate the Instagram system. If this is the case, Instagram hides or deprioritizes your posts while the app is otherwise functioning normally for you. A shadowban might be the end of all you’ve worked for.</p><p>Those who try to game the system by buying likes or by using third-party cheats will have their accounts shadowbanned. If you’re looking to artificially boost your engagement, you’ll come across apps and services which automatically like or comment on your posts. Don’t eat or drink anything from these people.</p><h3 id="3-You-Post-Too-Frequently-or-Too-Infrequently-on-Your-Blog-3"><a href="#3-You-Post-Too-Frequently-or-Too-Infrequently-on-Your-Blog-3" class="headerlink" title="3.You Post Too Frequently or Too Infrequently on Your Blog "></a>3.You Post Too Frequently or Too Infrequently on Your Blog <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/way3-post-frequently-or-infrequently.png"                      alt="way3-post-frequently-or-infrequently"                ></h3><p>You’ll lose followers if you bombard them with photographs on a regular basis. Conversely, if you don’t publish often enough, people will assume you’re not worth following. For sponsored articles and interactions with brands, this is particularly true.</p><p>It’s a delicate balancing act, and there isn’t a magic number or guideline to follow.

Besides, you can also drag the corners of the video to resize to get the borders.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/zoom-out-video-add-frame.jpg"                      alt="kapwing add borders to video"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: When you’re happy with the results, go to the top and select <strong>Export Video</strong> to save the video to your computer.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/export-video-with-borders-kapwing.jpg"                      alt="kapwing export video"                ></p><p>Note: if you want to remove the watermark after exporting, you may need to sign in a new account or sign up.</p><h3 id="2-Canva-3"><a href="#2-Canva-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Canva"></a>2. Canva</h3><p>Canva is a must-have software for anybody who modifies both pictures and videos. It may be accessed from both a smartphone and a computer. Furthermore, the free edition has all of the functionality you’ll ever require. Here’s your step-by-step guide to add border to video for Instagram using Canva:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Try downloading and <em>launching</em> the <strong>Canva app</strong>, or use the web browser to access it. Then go to <strong>Social media</strong> and pick your preferred film aspect ratio. Here I will choose Instagram Post.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/create-instagram-story-canva.jpg"                      alt="create instagram story video on canva"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Then upload the video to <strong>Canva</strong> to modify it and apply a border. To do so, go to the left pane and choose <strong>Upload media</strong> from the <strong>Uploads</strong> menu. Now navigate to the video’s location and post it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/upload-media-canva.jpg"                      alt="upload media to canva"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> The clip will appear under the <strong>Videos</strong> section in the <strong>Uploads</strong> category. To view the clip in the editing window, click on it. You may move the video around by dragging it.</p><p>(<strong>Note:</strong> If you’d rather use vibrant colors than plain old white borders, the color tab (top) provides a large color pallet to select from, as shown below).</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/change-background-color-border-canva.jpg"                      alt="change background color in canva"                ></p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>Well, there you have it – how you can add borders to <strong>Video Frame Instagram</strong>. Undoubtedly, Instagram is among the most active social media platform to millions and billions of daily users. One particular growing trend among the Instagram users observed lately has been the addition of Borders to their videos or pictures to give it a more stylistic appeal.</p><p>That is why we decided to compile everything about those new users who cannot find their way to this.

That is one of the reasons why it is relatively easy to connect your Facebook and Instagram accounts and share all content with your followers on both networks. Posting IGTV videos to Facebook and Instagram is a task so intuitive that you can hardly make a mistake. So, in this article, we are going to show you three different methods you can utilize to share all the videos you post on IGTV to Facebook.</p><h2 id="How-to-Share-IGTV-Videos-to-Facebook"><a href="#How-to-Share-IGTV-Videos-to-Facebook" class="headerlink" title="How to Share IGTV Videos to Facebook"></a>How to Share IGTV Videos to Facebook</h2><p>If you are posting IGTV videos frequently you may want to extend the pool of possible viewers in order to get more traffic on each post you share.

The intention of the highlights is to show instantaneously to viewers of your profile the content of your stories or brand, making navigation to your content easier. Before you can create your highlight, however, you will need to have a story on your profile. Create the story which you wish to highlight.

The ability to create highlights puts the stories into the profile until the highlight is deleted using the methods previously mentioned. If you happen to forget to add a story to your highlights within 24 hours, you can still access the story in your archives. Instagram automatically archives stories, meaning that the content you wish to save for a later date can be kept in the archive until you wish to put that material into a highlight.</p><p>Highlights ensure that visitors to your Instagram do not have to scroll through the content of your profile to find information concerning your brand. Additionally, by creating content-saturated Highlights, you set the tone for the viewer.</p><p>Businesses should understand how to create a highlight on Instagram as the potential for conversions is substantial when using them.

Use the methods on how to create highlights on Instagram from archives or how to make highlights on Instagram to showcase your stories.</p><p>Although the highlights are essential to brand building and conversions, they should be coupled with the Swipe-up feature, tap-to-view link features, and the content therein. Brands that have annual or semi-annual events should merge bits from prior stories with new content.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>Instagram has over 200 million daily views making it the perfect platform for visual branding and sharing content. Categorizing your stories and content in a concise method is fundamental to establishing a high level of conversions.

How should we organise our Instagram business profile, and how can we keep it separate from our personal accounts? Here, we’ll investigate how to create an Instagram business account so that your business can benefit from this massively popular social network too.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">How to set up Instagram Business Account</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Should you switch to business account?</a></li></ul><h2 id="How-to-set-up-Instagram-Business-Account"><a href="#How-to-set-up-Instagram-Business-Account" class="headerlink" title="How to set up Instagram Business Account"></a>How to set up Instagram Business Account</h2><p> Making the move to an Instagram business account is straightforward, so here’s a step by step introduction to setting up your Instagram business profile in moments.</p><h4 id="1-Switch-to-Instagram-business-profile"><a href="#1-Switch-to-Instagram-business-profile" class="headerlink" title="1.  Switch to Instagram business profile"></a>1.  Switch to Instagram business profile</h4><p> Log into your personal Instagram account to start this process. If you don’t have an account, you’ll need to create an Instagram account to get started.</p><p> Once into your Instagram account, simply open your account settings which you’ll find in the cog at the top right of your screen when looking at your profile. Near the bottom of the menu you’ll find the option to ‘Switch to Business Profile’. Choose this to find out how to create Instagram business account.</p><h4 id="2-Set-up-your-profile"><a href="#2-Set-up-your-profile" class="headerlink" title="2.  Set up your profile"></a>2.  Set up your profile</h4><p> Once you’ve pressed the option to switch to a business profile, you’ll see a request to connect your Instagram account to your Facebook page, with a blue link to ‘view features’. This is how to create Instagram account for your business.</p><p> In this menu you’ll be able to connect to your Facebook page, which is the best place to start. You’ll be asked which Facebook page you want to connect to; note that you can only set up an Instagram business account for pages which you administer yourself. You may only connect one Instagram business profile with each Facebook page.</p><p> From here, you can pull down contact information such as your customer service telephone number, your street address and your email contacts. You need to add at least one contact feature in order to create your Instagram business account.</p><h4 id="3-Check-your-new-Instagram-business-profile"><a href="#3-Check-your-new-Instagram-business-profile" class="headerlink" title="3.  Check your new Instagram business profile"></a>3.  Check your new Instagram business profile</h4><p> Once you’ve finished setting up your account, you can switch back to your personal account and navigate to your new Instagram business account to see how it looks from an outsider’s point of view. Try tapping the ‘contact’ button to see what sort of interaction options are available to your visitors.</p><p> Make sure you are only providing the relevant information at this stage. For example, if you are a fully online business, your customers won’t need to get directions to your address, so you can go ahead and remove your location from the contact options. If you don’t really use the phone number for business, you can choose to switch it to text message only within your Instagram business profile settings.</p><h4 id="4-Check-out-Instagram-for-business-features"><a href="#4-Check-out-Instagram-for-business-features" class="headerlink" title="4.  Check out Instagram for business features"></a>4.  Check out Instagram for business features</h4><p> Now you know how to create Instagram business account, you also need to manage it well too. There are a few features which set business accounts apart from standard user accounts, and some of these can be very useful to you in getting the most from your new Instagram business profile.</p><ul><li><strong>Insights:</strong> You’ll find the insights button at the top of your business profile next to the settings icon. Here you can see impressions, reach and clicks to your website, which are updated on a weekly basis. This feature also tracks your engagement metrics on a post by post basis, so that you can tailor what you’re posting to get more from your channel.</li><li><strong>Promote:</strong> Posts in Instagram can be boosted in a similar way to those on Facebook. This is not the same as running an ad, which you could also consider doing, but is a way to ensure more people see the content that you’ve posted.</li><li><strong>Profile:</strong> Your Instagram business profile looks and feels different to the generic user account, which is a good thing. It allows users to find out about your business, to get directions or contact information for you and to click shoppable links directly.</li></ul><p> Take some time to get to know your new Instagram business account, so that you can set in place a powerful strategy to maximize your impact on this busy social channel.</p><p> So, now you know how to create Instagram business account and how to manage it too, but one question remains; should you?</p><h2 id="Should-you-switch-to-business-account"><a href="#Should-you-switch-to-business-account" class="headerlink" title="Should you switch to business account?"></a>Should you switch to business account?</h2><p> With more than 800 million users and 500 million active each day, Instagram is by far the biggest and busiest social sharing network on the planet. But are there real advantages to switching to an Instagram business profile, or could you just promote your business through a standard account instead? Let’s find out:</p><h4 id="Pros-of-switching-to-an-Instagram-business-account"><a href="#Pros-of-switching-to-an-Instagram-business-account" class="headerlink" title="Pros of switching to an Instagram business account"></a>Pros of switching to an Instagram business account</h4><p> Some of the real advantages of working with a business account include:</p><ul><li><strong>Getting found more easily:</strong> Prior to Instagram business profiles being included in the platform, the only way your customers could find or contact you was by visiting your page and clicking the link to your website. The new profiles make it much easier for people to find you, contact you and, of course, buy your products. Useful analytics: In the past, the only way to draw down analytics from Instagram was through third party apps. With the new Instagram business profile, you can monitor your posts, clicks, engagement and reach all in one simple place. This will help inform your activity on Instagram and allow you to spend your time on the most productive activities.</li><li><strong>Paid ad options:</strong> Alongside the roll out of business profiles, Instagram have beefed up their ad options too.

Stories act like promoted posts, appearing at the top of your user’s news feed and encouraging engagement, so having active links to products or your website here is gold dust.</li></ul><p> You must admit, there are some pretty powerful reasons for knowing how to create Instagram account for your business, many of which could see your enterprise drawing in new customers and new opportunities. But is that the whole story?</p><h4 id="Drawbacks-of-the-Instagram-business-profile-3"><a href="#Drawbacks-of-the-Instagram-business-profile-3" class="headerlink" title="Drawbacks of the Instagram business profile"></a>Drawbacks of the Instagram business profile</h4><p> As with any new features, there are also some drawbacks to owning an Instagram business account. Here’s what you need to be aware of when thinking about how to create Instagram account for your company:</p><ul><li><strong>Facebook requirement:</strong> In order to set up a business account on Instagram you also need to have an existing Facebook page for your business. However, the majority of businesses already make use of Facebook, and if you don’t, then you probably should.</li><li><strong>Engagement problems:</strong> Instagram is owned by Facebook, and just like Facebook, they want you to pay for ads. While they are fairly tight lipped about how their post visibility algorithm works, some users have reported a negative impact on their engagement as a result of switching. The data on this is limited at this stage, but it’s worth keeping in mind if you’re not a business willing to pay for your exposure.</li></ul><p> So now you know how to create Instagram business account functionality, and how to use it, as well as whether it’s a good idea for you. Will you make the switch?</p><h2 id="And-the-winner-is-3"><a href="#And-the-winner-is-3" class="headerlink" title="And the winner is?"></a>And the winner is?</h2><p> Right now, more than 15 million businesses are already using an Instagram business account, so in order to keep up with the competition, it makes sense to make the switch. It seems there will be no going back to the chronologically organized platform it used to be, and with all the massive benefits to switching, it makes absolute sense to adapt to the changing landscape.</p><p> Social marketing has the real potential to have a positive effect on your bottom line, with <a class="link"   href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/695183/social-media-marketing-profitability/" >75 per cent of businesses <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> stating a significant or some positive return on investment, and thanks to these new business profiles, Instagram is set to be a real contributor to your profits. Our clear winner is the Instagram business profile, so make the switch today and let us know how it works for you!</p><p><img                       lazyload

The Stories feature of Instagram might be added a few years back, but it is already accessed by over 500 million active users. If you <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >explore the Instagram Stories feature <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, then you will realize it offers different ways to interact with our audience, like polls and questions. In this post, I’m going to let you know <strong>how to do a poll on Instagram</strong> and will also share some interesting ideas to post poll questions for Instagram. Let’s get it started!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/instagram-poll.jpg"                      alt="Instagram Poll"                ></p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: What is an Instagram Poll?</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 2: Why are Instagram Polls Important?</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Part 3: How to Create an Instagram Story Poll</a></li><li><a href="#part4">Part 4: Creative Instagram Poll Questions and Ideas</a></li><li><a href="#part5">Part 5: Explore More Ways to Use Instagram Polls</a></li></ul><h2 id="What-is-an-Instagram-Poll"><a href="#What-is-an-Instagram-Poll" class="headerlink" title="What is an Instagram Poll?"></a>What is an Instagram Poll?</h2><p>It is a newly-added feature in Instagram Stories that lets us host a poll on our profile (for at most 24 hours). All you need to do is add the Poll feature and enter the provided options. As of now, it only supports two options (like yes or no). Once the poll is posted on your story, your audience can select either of the options. You will get to know the results (who voted for which option) and can even share it with your audience as a story later on.</p><h2 id="Why-is-Instagram-Polls-Important"><a href="#Why-is-Instagram-Polls-Important" class="headerlink" title="Why is Instagram Polls Important?"></a>Why is Instagram Polls Important?</h2><p>It doesn’t matter if you are managing your own or a brand’s profile, Instagram Polls can help you in more ways than you can think of.

For instance, if your brand is working on a new line of products and you are not sure about something, then why not post it on Instagram. In this way, you can know the feedback of its end-users and would help in the product’s development as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/get-instant-ig-poll-feedback.jpg"                      alt="Instant Instagram Poll Feedback"                ></p><h4 id="2-Be-Creative-2"><a href="#2-Be-Creative-2" class="headerlink" title="2.

Instead of posting a simple yes&#x2F;no poll, why not use emojis.</p><p>Let’s consider that you manage the Instagram profile of a beverage brand. Why not post a picture of a beach and ask your audience which beverage of yours they would enjoy the most. This would be quite an interesting post and will improve the engagement rate on your profile.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/creative-ig-poll.jpg"                      alt="Creative Instagram Poll"                ></p><h4 id="3-Redirect-your-audience-2"><a href="#3-Redirect-your-audience-2" class="headerlink" title="3.

Though, apart from simply posting your products, you can ask your audience their opinion about it. Besides that, you can also include your website’s link or a DM option on the story. This will help you redirect your audience to your product page and can increase its sales as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/redirect-audience-ig-poll.jpg"                      alt="redirect audience Instagram Poll"                ></p><h4 id="4-Think-Beyond-Polls-2"><a href="#4-Think-Beyond-Polls-2" class="headerlink" title="4.

You can consider posting a question as well to directly interact with your audience.</p><p>Not just that, you can also use a slider widget with a poll (or even without it). Instead of just selecting yes or no, this will let your audience slide their choice to a preferred value and will further spike their interest.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/think-beyond-poll.jpg"                      alt="Think Beyond Polls"                ></p><p>There you go!

This will help you redirect your audience to your product page and can increase its sales as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/redirect-audience-ig-poll.jpg"                      alt="redirect audience Instagram Poll"                ></p><h4 id="4-Think-Beyond-Polls-3"><a href="#4-Think-Beyond-Polls-3" class="headerlink" title="4. Think Beyond Polls"></a>4. Think Beyond Polls</h4><p>While Instagram Polls are undoubtedly one of the best ways to engage with your audience, there are plenty of other features that you can try. You can consider posting a question as well to directly interact with your audience.</p><p>Not just that, you can also use a slider widget with a poll (or even without it). Instead of just selecting yes or no, this will let your audience slide their choice to a preferred value and will further spike their interest.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/think-beyond-poll.jpg"                      alt="Think Beyond Polls"                ></p><p>There you go! I’m sure that after reading this post, you would make the most of Instagram Polls. I have come up with a stepwise tutorial on how to do a poll on Instagram for beginners that anyone can implement.

The latest buzz on Snapchat, Instagram and Facebook are the hilarious gender swap pictures that let you see how you would look like if you were a man or a woman. However, at the moment there are only a few apps that offer gender swap effects, so you must either use Snapchat or the FaceApp to swap genders. That is why in this article we are going to show you a few different methods of creating gender swap photos with these two apps.</p><h2 id="Swapping-Gender-with-Snapchat-Filters"><a href="#Swapping-Gender-with-Snapchat-Filters" class="headerlink" title="Swapping Gender with Snapchat Filters"></a>Swapping Gender with Snapchat Filters</h2><p>Snapchat introduced three new filters that caught the attention of the crowd on social media because they highlight masculine or feminine characteristics of facial traits. The ‘man lens’ will make your jawline shaper, hair shorter and your beard longer, while the ‘woman lens’ makes your skin look softer or applies some makeup to your face. The ‘baby lens’ however, is by far the most popular of the three because it enables people to see how they would look like if they were less than six months old.</p><p>Taking a photo of yourself while any of these filters is enabled is a simple process that won’t take more than a few seconds.

Sadly there is no indication that either Facebook or Instagram are going to introduce new gender swap filters in the near future and Snapchat is still one of your best options if you want to create this type of photos.</p><h2 id="Install-FaceApp-to-Your-iPhone-or-Android-Device-3"><a href="#Install-FaceApp-to-Your-iPhone-or-Android-Device-3" class="headerlink" title="Install FaceApp to Your iPhone or Android Device "></a>Install FaceApp to Your iPhone or Android Device <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/faceapp-change-gender.jpg"                      alt="Change Gender with FaceApp"                ></h2><p>The <a class="link"   href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/faceapp-ai-face-editor/id1180884341?mt=8" >FaceApp <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a strong alternative to the newly added gender swap effects on Snapchat because it offers more gender swap filters and it makes sharing the images on Facebook or Instagram much easier. The app can be downloaded for free from the AppStore or <a class="link"   href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.faceapp&hl=en" >GooglePlay Store <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, but you must make in-app purchases if you want to unlock its Pro features. However, even the free version of the app utilizes Artificial Intelligence and neural nets to analyze a vast amount of images and use the findings to make your face look more masculine or more feminine.</p><p>The app’s users can either take new photos or edit the pictures they’ve taken with another app, but some filters are only available if you purchase a monthly or an annual subscription. The FaceApp lets you put on a new smile, swap genders or use the cool style filters to take better selfies. You can experiment with different looks and see how you’d look like if you were a Hollywood superstar or if you had a long blonde hair. Once you find the look that all of your friends must see, you can share the gender swap photo to Instagram or Facebook with a single tap.</p><p> <strong>Read More to Get :</strong> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >How to Screenshot on Snapchat without Them Knowing &gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>Taking a swap gender photo is going to cheer up your day and give your friends on social media a good laugh.

That is why fake like buying has become such a popular idea among influencers.</p><p> But it is not recommended for influencers to buy fake likes on Instagram.

But the platform began to <a class="link"   href="https://later.com/blog/instagram-influencer-vacations/" >care more about engagement <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> instead of followers, which is why brands are very interested in the likes that you are getting on each post.</p><p> Now people think about buying likes if they feel their engagement levels are not rising quickly enough for them to get more exposure or interesting sponsorship offers.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ins-why-buy-fake-likes.JPG"                      alt="why buy fake likes"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-3-Reasons-to-Avoid-Buying-Instagram-Likes"><a href="#Part-2-3-Reasons-to-Avoid-Buying-Instagram-Likes" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: 3 Reasons to Avoid Buying Instagram Likes"></a>Part 2: 3 Reasons to Avoid Buying Instagram Likes</h2><h3 id="1-It-Will-Harm-Your-Engagement"><a href="#1-It-Will-Harm-Your-Engagement" class="headerlink" title="1. It Will Harm Your Engagement"></a>1. It Will Harm Your Engagement</h3><p> When you have more followers on Instagram, it is inevitable that your engagement levels will decline. When an account has less than 1,000 followers, the engagement levels are around eight percent. It goes down to four percent when you have between 1,000 and 10,000 followers. Between 10,000 to 100,000 followers has an engagement level of around 2.4%. And it goes down to 1.7% when you are at a million.</p><p> What do all these numbers mean? It means that if you were to buy likes, you would be arousing suspicion of brands who may want to hire you for sponsorship purposes. Say you are buying a lot of likes because they are cheaper to get than followers. If you have 15,000 followers and an engagement level of 6 or 7 percent, your account is suspicious.</p><h2 id="2-Buying-Fake-Likes-is-a-Black-Hole"><a href="#2-Buying-Fake-Likes-is-a-Black-Hole" class="headerlink" title="2. Buying Fake Likes is a Black Hole"></a>2. Buying Fake Likes is a Black Hole</h2><p> It is so easy to think that you will be purchasing fake likes on Instagram for one or two uses. “I just want to promote a couple of my posts to gain exposure.” These are the words that every like buyer utters. A month later, they are furiously buying likes for every single post they put up on Instagram.</p><p> It is a vicious cycle, because you become addicted to those bought likes. And if you are doing all this to impress brands, you must keep up your engagement levels or they will assume you had a post go viral, which is not necessarily indicative of a popular account.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ins-rules.JPG"                      alt="ins fake likes"                ></p><h3 id="3-Violation-of-Instagram-Rules"><a href="#3-Violation-of-Instagram-Rules" class="headerlink" title="3. Violation of Instagram Rules"></a>3. Violation of Instagram Rules</h3><p> Instagram has very strict guidelines and rules of engagement. Buying likes and followers is against those rules. Of course, they are not going to strike down every single account that buys likes and followers. If they did, it would completely stop as a practice.</p><p> But there is a good chance that you will get caught eventually. And the risk is that your entire account is deleted, including all your followers, likes and posts. You may have a hard time opening up another account with the same identity.</p><p> And many of the sites that offer like buying services get shut down, which instantly impacts the likes you get on your next posts. It can turn into a race of you buying more likes from other sellers, until they get shut down too.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Identify-Accounts-with-Fake-Likes"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Identify-Accounts-with-Fake-Likes" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Identify Accounts with Fake Likes"></a>Part 3: How to Identify Accounts with Fake Likes</h2><h3 id="1-Followers-and-Engagement-Levels-Are-Off"><a href="#1-Followers-and-Engagement-Levels-Are-Off" class="headerlink" title="1. Followers and Engagement Levels Are Off"></a>1. Followers and Engagement Levels Are Off</h3><p> There can be anomalies in how many likes an Instagram post gets relative to the account’s followers. For instance, a post may be shared by an influencer and celebrity, causing it to go viral.</p><p> But accounts that have multiple posts with engagement levels of 9 or 10 percent, or even higher, are immediately suspicious. It is not probable for an account to have such a high level of engagement without some like buying.</p><p> Those who are insistent on buying likes will need to buy followers to match up the engagement levels with the numbers we mentioned above. But it is more hassle than it is worth!</p><h3 id="2-Posts-and-Likes-Do-Not-Match-Up"><a href="#2-Posts-and-Likes-Do-Not-Match-Up" class="headerlink" title="2. Posts and Likes Do Not Match Up"></a>2. Posts and Likes Do Not Match Up</h3><p> When an account has very few posts, but any likes on each post, it is unusual. It generally takes a lot of posts before an account can rack up a high follower and like count. The only time accounts with few posts have a lot of likes is when they are started by a celebrity.</p><p> If you notice an influencer has three or four posts in the past month, but they have thousands of likes on each post, it is suspicious. There is a good chance the influencer used inauthentic methods of gaining those likes.</p><h3 id="3-Spam-Comments"><a href="#3-Spam-Comments" class="headerlink" title="3. Spam Comments"></a>3. Spam Comments</h3><p> Ever noticed that some Instagram accounts are dominated by spam comments? You may see two or three genuine-sounding comments in the section. Everything else is some version of “follow me” or a single word phrase. It is indicative of an account where likes, followers and comments are bought.</p><p> Influencers think they can trick people into buying their engagement levels with spam comments. But companies that care about where they spend their marketing budget will do research that goes beyond a cursory glance at the number of followers, likes and comments. They will notice spam comments.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ins-spam-comment.JPG"                      alt="spam comment"                ></p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p> Instagram is about so much more than showing off your latest look or meal. It is a platform dominated by influencers, which is why brands are so interested in leveraging it for their own success. Influencers get tempted to buy likes so they can raise their profile and attract better sponsorship offers.</p><p> But purchasing likes on Instagram is a complex process that is fairly easy to spot. Unless you want to go down a black hole of constantly buying likes and followers, it is best to focus your efforts on organically growing your follower count and engagement levels.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shannon-cox.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Shanoon Cox</p><p>Shanoon Cox is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Shanoon Cox</p><h5 id="Shanoon-Cox-1"><a href="#Shanoon-Cox-1" class="headerlink" title="Shanoon Cox"></a>Shanoon Cox</h5><p> Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions</p><p> Many influencers believe they have found a secret to quick growth on Instagram - buying fake likes.
