Apart from issuing voice commands, you can also get the tool to read out ChatGPT’s responses using different AI voices.</p><h3 id="Voice-Control-for-ChatGPT"><a href="#Voice-Control-for-ChatGPT" class="headerlink" title="Voice Control for ChatGPT"></a><a class="link"   href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/voice-control-for-chatgpt/eollffkcakegifhacjnlnegohfdlidhn" >Voice Control for ChatGPT <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://bluetties.sjv.io/c/5597632/2039292/17094" target="_top" id="2039292"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17094-2039292"                      border="0" alt="BLUETTI NEW LAUNCH AC240" width="954" height="1020"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2039292/17094"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/voice-control-for-chatgpt-chrome-extension.jpg"                      alt="voice control for ChatGPT chrome extension"                ></p><p> Voice Control for ChatGPT is exactly what the name says—it gives you the ability to prompt ChatGPT with voice commands while it reads back the responses if you prefer. Once installed and activated, the Chrome extension adds several buttons just below the ChatGPT prompt text box, which you can use to control your voice interaction with ChatGPT.</p><p> Unlike Talk-to-ChatGPT and VoiceWave, editing out mistakes or mistranscribed words is a bit complex since the text is not directly injected into ChatGPT’s prompt text box. It takes a bit of getting used to, but it’s an excellent speech-to-text tool nonetheless.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://purchase.swifdoo.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=38709260&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/8b932759a5a04ddb34bf79e3f9072e4b/products/Product%20box%20white-1024x1024.png"                      border="0"                >SwifDoo PDF Perpetual (2-PC)  Free upgrade. No monthly fees ever. </a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Will-ChatGPT-Get-An-Official-Audio-Input-Feature"><a href="#Will-ChatGPT-Get-An-Official-Audio-Input-Feature" class="headerlink" title="Will ChatGPT Get An Official Audio Input Feature?"></a>Will ChatGPT Get An Official Audio Input Feature?</h2><p> Despite popular demand for a voice input feature, OpenAI has kept its ChatGPT interface as basic as possible.

This photo and video sharing platform can help you reach new like-minded people, increase the sales of your products or simply share your favorite photos with the people you care about, but your Instagram posts won’t get the amount of attention they deserve if you don’t use the hidden tricks that can assist you in increasing the number of followers on your Instagram account.</p><p> Regardless of the reason why you are using Instagram, the tips featured in this article may provide assistance in mastering this platform and boosting the traffic on your account.</p><p><strong>You May Also Like:</strong> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >How to Make Money from Instagram - 2018 Ultimate Guide &gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Top-Instagram-Hidden-Tips-and-Tricks-1"><a href="#Top-Instagram-Hidden-Tips-and-Tricks-1" class="headerlink" title="Top Instagram Hidden Tips and Tricks"></a>Top Instagram Hidden Tips and Tricks</h2><p> The key to success in life is consistency. The same can be said for Instagram since you can’t really expect to get thousands of likes on each post if you don’t add new content to your Instagram account consistently. Let’s explore Instagram’s hidden tips and tricks and see how you can enjoy even more success on this unique platform.</p><h3 id="1-Download-videos-and-photos-in-batches"><a href="#1-Download-videos-and-photos-in-batches" class="headerlink" title="1. Download videos and photos in batches"></a>1. Download videos and photos in batches</h3><p> Unlike Facebook, Instagram is trying to protect its users from copyright violations. However, not being able to download the videos and photos you posted to Instagram can be a problem if you lost the original files or if you just want to create a backup of your Instagram posts.</p><p><a class="link"   href="http://insta-downloader.net/" >Insta-downloader.net <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a website that enables you to download photos and videos from Instagram, while it also provides the option to download all images featured on an Instagram account.

Upload photos and videos from your computer"></a>2. Upload photos and videos from your computer</h3><p> The Instagram app can’t be installed on a computer, while the upload feature is not available on Instagram profiles when viewed from a computer-based web browser. As social media managers and professional photographers know working with large amounts of images is much easier from a computer than it is from a Smartphone. In case you would like to post images to Instagram directly from your computer you can use an emulator like BlueStacks that will allow you to connect your Android device with a computer, and <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >post your photos and videos to Instagram directly from a PC. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> You May Also Like:</p><h3 id="3-Repost-Instagram-photos-and-videos"><a href="#3-Repost-Instagram-photos-and-videos" class="headerlink" title="3. Repost Instagram photos and videos"></a>3. Repost Instagram photos and videos</h3><p> There is so much inspiring content on Instagram, so why not use it to enrich your profile and attract more followers. Well, one reason is that Instagram doesn’t allow its users to share posts posted on other Instagram accounts. However, if you really want to repost Instagram photos and videos you can try using the <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Repost app <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, that can be downloaded from the App Store and Google Play, for free.</p><h3 id="4-Post-multiple-photos-at-the-same-time"><a href="#4-Post-multiple-photos-at-the-same-time" class="headerlink" title="4. Post multiple photos at the same time"></a>4. Post multiple photos at the same time</h3><p> Instead of creating a separate post for each new image you share on Instagram, now you can add up to 10 images in a single post and share them on your Instagram account. This recently added option is best used for images that are closely related because featuring images that have nothing in common in a single post can be quite confusing.</p><p> The ‘Select Multiple’ feature enables you to select photos from your Camera Roll and post them to your Instagram account.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=194977&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.blumentals.net/scrfactory/images/screensaver-software.png"                      border="0"                >Screensaver Factory, Create stunning professional screensavers within minutes.

Let’s explore Instagram’s hidden tips and tricks and see how you can enjoy even more success on this unique platform.</p><h3 id="1-Download-videos-and-photos-in-batches-3"><a href="#1-Download-videos-and-photos-in-batches-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Download videos and photos in batches"></a>1. Download videos and photos in batches</h3><p> Unlike Facebook, Instagram is trying to protect its users from copyright violations. However, not being able to download the videos and photos you posted to Instagram can be a problem if you lost the original files or if you just want to create a backup of your Instagram posts.</p><p><a class="link"   href="http://insta-downloader.net/" >Insta-downloader.net <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a website that enables you to download photos and videos from Instagram, while it also provides the option to download all images featured on an Instagram account.

Upload photos and videos from your computer"></a>2. Upload photos and videos from your computer</h3><p> The Instagram app can’t be installed on a computer, while the upload feature is not available on Instagram profiles when viewed from a computer-based web browser. As social media managers and professional photographers know working with large amounts of images is much easier from a computer than it is from a Smartphone. In case you would like to post images to Instagram directly from your computer you can use an emulator like BlueStacks that will allow you to connect your Android device with a computer, and <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >post your photos and videos to Instagram directly from a PC. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> You May Also Like:</p><h3 id="3-Repost-Instagram-photos-and-videos-3"><a href="#3-Repost-Instagram-photos-and-videos-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Repost Instagram photos and videos"></a>3. Repost Instagram photos and videos</h3><p> There is so much inspiring content on Instagram, so why not use it to enrich your profile and attract more followers. Well, one reason is that Instagram doesn’t allow its users to share posts posted on other Instagram accounts. However, if you really want to repost Instagram photos and videos you can try using the <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Repost app <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, that can be downloaded from the App Store and Google Play, for free.</p><h3 id="4-Post-multiple-photos-at-the-same-time-3"><a href="#4-Post-multiple-photos-at-the-same-time-3" class="headerlink" title="4. Post multiple photos at the same time"></a>4. Post multiple photos at the same time</h3><p> Instead of creating a separate post for each new image you share on Instagram, now you can add up to 10 images in a single post and share them on your Instagram account. This recently added option is best used for images that are closely related because featuring images that have nothing in common in a single post can be quite confusing.</p><p> The ‘Select Multiple’ feature enables you to select photos from your Camera Roll and post them to your Instagram account.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://natural-cycles.sjv.io/c/5597632/2072200/17885" target="_top" id="2072200"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17885-2072200"                      border="0" alt="" width="728" height="90"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2072200/17885"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="5-Add-hashtags-after-posting-3"><a href="#5-Add-hashtags-after-posting-3" class="headerlink" title="5.

That’s why you should post and share a photo or a video first, and then tap on the Edit button to add the hashtags you want to your Instagram post.</p><p> In this manner, you’ll be able to save a lot of time on deleting hashtags from the posts you shared on Facebook, Tumblr or any other social media platform.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.absolute.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4601998&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/ef70e26a0b5da778eda3f48014d087cd/728x90_larger-shield.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="6-Add-a-URL-to-your-bio-3"><a href="#6-Add-a-URL-to-your-bio-3" class="headerlink" title="6.

However, if you want to direct traffic from your Instagram account to a website or a blog you can <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >add a URL to your bio <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. The trick is to change the URL every time you start promoting a different project.</p><p> This tip can help you promote the products and services you’re offering on Instagram, and in addition, it can boost the conversion rates on your website, simply because more people will be able to see it.</p><h3 id="7-Send-photos-privately-to-a-specific-friend-3"><a href="#7-Send-photos-privately-to-a-specific-friend-3" class="headerlink" title="7. Send photos privately to a specific friend"></a>7. Send photos privately to a specific friend</h3><p> Tagging a friend in a post and having a public debate is not in accordance with everyone’s taste. Instagram however, provides the option to send a photo or a video to a friend privately. Having a private chat is a much better option if you had a more meaningful communication in mind than just exchanging a few emojis.</p><p> Furthermore, you can also send private messages to your Instagram followers by going to their profile and tapping on the Options icon that looks like three vertical black dots.

Use Instagram as a photo editor</h3><p> The photo editing features Instagram offers are truly magical, so if you need to edit a photo quickly you can use Instagram to do it. Enabling the Airplane mode will prevent the photo from being posted on your account, so before you start editing you should first switch to the Airplane mode, and make sure that the Instagram’s Save Original Photo option is activated.</p><p> Import the photo you’d like to edit to the Instagram app and apply filters or increase contrast or balance on your photo, and then proceed to share the picture. The app will report an error and inform you that the photo cannot be posted to your Instagram account, but the picture you edited will be saved in the photo gallery.</p><p> You may also like: <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Top 10 Best Instagram Photo Editors for 2018 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://versadesk.pxf.io/c/5597632/1892107/21290" target="_top" id="1892107"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/21290-1892107"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="628"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1892107/21290"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="9-Schedule-posts-in-advance-3"><a href="#9-Schedule-posts-in-advance-3" class="headerlink" title="9.

However, this Instagram tip works only if you have a Business profile on Instagram, and you’ll also have to get a social media scheduling tool and a HubSpot software.</p><p> The actual steps you’ll need to take in order to schedule a post depend on the social media scheduling tool you are using, so some additional research may be required before you can start scheduling your Instagram posts.</p><h3 id="10-Get-notifications-when-your-favorite-Instagram-friends-post-3"><a href="#10-Get-notifications-when-your-favorite-Instagram-friends-post-3" class="headerlink" title="10.

Get notifications when your favorite Instagram friends post</h3><p> If you want to, you can get notifications for each post from your friends, business associates, and influencers. Turning on notifications on Instagram is easy since all you need to do is go to the Instagram user’s profile and select the ‘Turn on Post Notifications’ options from the Settings menu. The settings icon looks like three black dots, in case you are having trouble finding it.</p><p> However, if you would like this trick to work you must allow Instagram to send you notifications in the first place. Head over to your phone’s Settings menu, select the Apps option, locate the Instagram app and choose the feature that enables notifications.</p><h3 id="11-Create-Story-Highlights-to-show-stories-for-longer-than-a-day-3"><a href="#11-Create-Story-Highlights-to-show-stories-for-longer-than-a-day-3" class="headerlink" title="11. Create Story Highlights to show stories for longer than a day"></a>11. Create Story Highlights to show stories for longer than a day</h3><p> The ephemeral content is becoming more popular every day, but some Instagram Stories deserve more attention than they can get in a single day. If you would like your Instagram Stories to stay online for longer than 24 hours you can create Story Highlights.</p><p> Simply click on the + icon below the profile picture on your Instagram account and select the stories you want to feature in the Story Highlight from the album. The Story Highlights will be visible on your Instagram profile, for as long as you want. Removing or changing the Story Highlights is a simple process that won’t take more than five minutes of your time.</p><h3 id="12-Create-and-manage-multiple-Instagram-accounts-3"><a href="#12-Create-and-manage-multiple-Instagram-accounts-3" class="headerlink" title="12. Create and manage multiple Instagram accounts"></a>12. Create and manage multiple Instagram accounts</h3><p> A good Instagram account is coherent because Instagrammers interested in fashion have almost zero interest in sports, so if you want to post images that cover both of these topics it is best to create different accounts. Instagram lets its users manage up to 5 interconnected accounts, which opens a plethora of opportunities for big companies that offer more than just one service as well as for up and coming startups that are looking for a big breakthrough in a certain niche.</p><p> If you want to create a new Instagram account, go to Options and tap on the Add New Account feature. You can use the same username and password for all of your Instagram accounts.</p><h2 id="Conclusion-2"><a href="#Conclusion-2" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p> Let us know in the comments which tricks and tips we didn’t mention in this article and share with us your favorite Instagram tricks.

Switch to Instagram business profile"></a>1.  Switch to Instagram business profile</h4><p> Log into your personal Instagram account to start this process. If you don’t have an account, you’ll need to create an Instagram account to get started.</p><p> Once into your Instagram account, simply open your account settings which you’ll find in the cog at the top right of your screen when looking at your profile. Near the bottom of the menu you’ll find the option to ‘Switch to Business Profile’. Choose this to find out how to create Instagram business account.</p><h4 id="2-Set-up-your-profile"><a href="#2-Set-up-your-profile" class="headerlink" title="2.  Set up your profile"></a>2.  Set up your profile</h4><p> Once you’ve pressed the option to switch to a business profile, you’ll see a request to connect your Instagram account to your Facebook page, with a blue link to ‘view features’. This is how to create Instagram account for your business.</p><p> In this menu you’ll be able to connect to your Facebook page, which is the best place to start. You’ll be asked which Facebook page you want to connect to; note that you can only set up an Instagram business account for pages which you administer yourself. You may only connect one Instagram business profile with each Facebook page.</p><p> From here, you can pull down contact information such as your customer service telephone number, your street address and your email contacts. You need to add at least one contact feature in order to create your Instagram business account.</p><h4 id="3-Check-your-new-Instagram-business-profile"><a href="#3-Check-your-new-Instagram-business-profile" class="headerlink" title="3.  Check your new Instagram business profile"></a>3.  Check your new Instagram business profile</h4><p> Once you’ve finished setting up your account, you can switch back to your personal account and navigate to your new Instagram business account to see how it looks from an outsider’s point of view. Try tapping the ‘contact’ button to see what sort of interaction options are available to your visitors.</p><p> Make sure you are only providing the relevant information at this stage. For example, if you are a fully online business, your customers won’t need to get directions to your address, so you can go ahead and remove your location from the contact options. If you don’t really use the phone number for business, you can choose to switch it to text message only within your Instagram business profile settings.</p><h4 id="4-Check-out-Instagram-for-business-features"><a href="#4-Check-out-Instagram-for-business-features" class="headerlink" title="4.  Check out Instagram for business features"></a>4.  Check out Instagram for business features</h4><p> Now you know how to create Instagram business account, you also need to manage it well too. There are a few features which set business accounts apart from standard user accounts, and some of these can be very useful to you in getting the most from your new Instagram business profile.</p><ul><li><strong>Insights:</strong> You’ll find the insights button at the top of your business profile next to the settings icon. Here you can see impressions, reach and clicks to your website, which are updated on a weekly basis. This feature also tracks your engagement metrics on a post by post basis, so that you can tailor what you’re posting to get more from your channel.</li><li><strong>Promote:</strong> Posts in Instagram can be boosted in a similar way to those on Facebook. This is not the same as running an ad, which you could also consider doing, but is a way to ensure more people see the content that you’ve posted.</li><li><strong>Profile:</strong> Your Instagram business profile looks and feels different to the generic user account, which is a good thing. It allows users to find out about your business, to get directions or contact information for you and to click shoppable links directly.</li></ul><p> Take some time to get to know your new Instagram business account, so that you can set in place a powerful strategy to maximize your impact on this busy social channel.</p><p> So, now you know how to create Instagram business account and how to manage it too, but one question remains; should you?</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.iobit.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4596923&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/184260348236f9554fe9375772ff966e/ascscan_468X60.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Should-you-switch-to-business-account"><a href="#Should-you-switch-to-business-account" class="headerlink" title="Should you switch to business account?"></a>Should you switch to business account?</h2><p> With more than 800 million users and 500 million active each day, Instagram is by far the biggest and busiest social sharing network on the planet. But are there real advantages to switching to an Instagram business profile, or could you just promote your business through a standard account instead? Let’s find out:</p><h4 id="Pros-of-switching-to-an-Instagram-business-account"><a href="#Pros-of-switching-to-an-Instagram-business-account" class="headerlink" title="Pros of switching to an Instagram business account"></a>Pros of switching to an Instagram business account</h4><p> Some of the real advantages of working with a business account include:</p><ul><li><strong>Getting found more easily:</strong> Prior to Instagram business profiles being included in the platform, the only way your customers could find or contact you was by visiting your page and clicking the link to your website. The new profiles make it much easier for people to find you, contact you and, of course, buy your products. Useful analytics: In the past, the only way to draw down analytics from Instagram was through third party apps. With the new Instagram business profile, you can monitor your posts, clicks, engagement and reach all in one simple place. This will help inform your activity on Instagram and allow you to spend your time on the most productive activities.</li><li><strong>Paid ad options:</strong> Alongside the roll out of business profiles, Instagram have beefed up their ad options too. When you hit a post on your business account, there is an option at the bottom to ‘promote’ that post. From here, you can add a call to action button, target specific audiences and choose when the ad should be run. Both boost posts and paid ads are possible with the powerful tools built into Instagram.</li><li><strong>Links on Stories:</strong> Now business Instagram accounts who have at least 10,000 followers can add links into their Stories. Stories act like promoted posts, appearing at the top of your user’s news feed and encouraging engagement, so having active links to products or your website here is gold dust.</li></ul><p> You must admit, there are some pretty powerful reasons for knowing how to create Instagram account for your business, many of which could see your enterprise drawing in new customers and new opportunities. But is that the whole story?</p><h4 id="Drawbacks-of-the-Instagram-business-profile"><a href="#Drawbacks-of-the-Instagram-business-profile" class="headerlink" title="Drawbacks of the Instagram business profile"></a>Drawbacks of the Instagram business profile</h4><p> As with any new features, there are also some drawbacks to owning an Instagram business account. Here’s what you need to be aware of when thinking about how to create Instagram account for your company:</p><ul><li><strong>Facebook requirement:</strong> In order to set up a business account on Instagram you also need to have an existing Facebook page for your business. However, the majority of businesses already make use of Facebook, and if you don’t, then you probably should.</li><li><strong>Engagement problems:</strong> Instagram is owned by Facebook, and just like Facebook, they want you to pay for ads. While they are fairly tight lipped about how their post visibility algorithm works, some users have reported a negative impact on their engagement as a result of switching. The data on this is limited at this stage, but it’s worth keeping in mind if you’re not a business willing to pay for your exposure.</li></ul><p> So now you know how to create Instagram business account functionality, and how to use it, as well as whether it’s a good idea for you. Will you make the switch?</p><h2 id="And-the-winner-is"><a href="#And-the-winner-is" class="headerlink" title="And the winner is?"></a>And the winner is?</h2><p> Right now, more than 15 million businesses are already using an Instagram business account, so in order to keep up with the competition, it makes sense to make the switch.

There are a few features which set business accounts apart from standard user accounts, and some of these can be very useful to you in getting the most from your new Instagram business profile.</p><ul><li><strong>Insights:</strong> You’ll find the insights button at the top of your business profile next to the settings icon. Here you can see impressions, reach and clicks to your website, which are updated on a weekly basis. This feature also tracks your engagement metrics on a post by post basis, so that you can tailor what you’re posting to get more from your channel.</li><li><strong>Promote:</strong> Posts in Instagram can be boosted in a similar way to those on Facebook. This is not the same as running an ad, which you could also consider doing, but is a way to ensure more people see the content that you’ve posted.</li><li><strong>Profile:</strong> Your Instagram business profile looks and feels different to the generic user account, which is a good thing.

But are there real advantages to switching to an Instagram business profile, or could you just promote your business through a standard account instead? Let’s find out:</p><h4 id="Pros-of-switching-to-an-Instagram-business-account-2"><a href="#Pros-of-switching-to-an-Instagram-business-account-2" class="headerlink" title="Pros of switching to an Instagram business account"></a>Pros of switching to an Instagram business account</h4><p> Some of the real advantages of working with a business account include:</p><ul><li><strong>Getting found more easily:</strong> Prior to Instagram business profiles being included in the platform, the only way your customers could find or contact you was by visiting your page and clicking the link to your website. The new profiles make it much easier for people to find you, contact you and, of course, buy your products. Useful analytics: In the past, the only way to draw down analytics from Instagram was through third party apps. With the new Instagram business profile, you can monitor your posts, clicks, engagement and reach all in one simple place. This will help inform your activity on Instagram and allow you to spend your time on the most productive activities.</li><li><strong>Paid ad options:</strong> Alongside the roll out of business profiles, Instagram have beefed up their ad options too. When you hit a post on your business account, there is an option at the bottom to ‘promote’ that post. From here, you can add a call to action button, target specific audiences and choose when the ad should be run. Both boost posts and paid ads are possible with the powerful tools built into Instagram.</li><li><strong>Links on Stories:</strong> Now business Instagram accounts who have at least 10,000 followers can add links into their Stories. Stories act like promoted posts, appearing at the top of your user’s news feed and encouraging engagement, so having active links to products or your website here is gold dust.</li></ul><p> You must admit, there are some pretty powerful reasons for knowing how to create Instagram account for your business, many of which could see your enterprise drawing in new customers and new opportunities. But is that the whole story?</p><h4 id="Drawbacks-of-the-Instagram-business-profile-2"><a href="#Drawbacks-of-the-Instagram-business-profile-2" class="headerlink" title="Drawbacks of the Instagram business profile"></a>Drawbacks of the Instagram business profile</h4><p> As with any new features, there are also some drawbacks to owning an Instagram business account. Here’s what you need to be aware of when thinking about how to create Instagram account for your company:</p><ul><li><strong>Facebook requirement:</strong> In order to set up a business account on Instagram you also need to have an existing Facebook page for your business. However, the majority of businesses already make use of Facebook, and if you don’t, then you probably should.</li><li><strong>Engagement problems:</strong> Instagram is owned by Facebook, and just like Facebook, they want you to pay for ads. While they are fairly tight lipped about how their post visibility algorithm works, some users have reported a negative impact on their engagement as a result of switching. The data on this is limited at this stage, but it’s worth keeping in mind if you’re not a business willing to pay for your exposure.</li></ul><p> So now you know how to create Instagram business account functionality, and how to use it, as well as whether it’s a good idea for you.

Perhaps the most important thing is to know the audience you are targeting as it will allow you to create the content that is more appealing to the ideal viewer of your IGTV videos. Let’s have a look at a few methods you can use to get more followers on IGTV.</p><p><strong>Tips and tricks:</strong> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Converting YouTube video and Posting it on IGTV&gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h4 id="1-Optimize-Your-Profile-to-Gain-More-Followers"><a href="#1-Optimize-Your-Profile-to-Gain-More-Followers" class="headerlink" title="1.

Optimize Your Profile to Gain More Followers</h4><p> Every detail matters, from the name of your channel to the thumbnail picture you select for each of the videos you add to your IGTV channel. Putting keywords that best reflect what your business or your videos are about into your Instagram profile is important because by doing so your IGTV channel will be much easier to find. Even if you already have a big social media following, using keywords in your profile may get you a step closer to expanding the audience your IGTV videos can reach.</p><h4 id="2-Discover-the-Best-Time-to-Post-New-Videos-and-Share-New-Content-Frequently"><a href="#2-Discover-the-Best-Time-to-Post-New-Videos-and-Share-New-Content-Frequently" class="headerlink" title="2.

Discover the Best Time to Post New Videos and Share New Content Frequently</h4><p> Once again, knowing your audience and when they are the most likely to be using IGTV is essential for boosting the number of followers. The time zone in which your ideal viewer lives in or their age play an important role in choosing the time when you post new content to your IGTV channel. In general, the best time to post new videos on IGTV is from 8 p.m. to 10 p.m. from Monday to Thursday, but you should try posting at different times of the day and see what produces the best results.</p><p> Posting new videos on your IGTV channel regularly is probably more important than sharing videos at an exact same time because your followers will gradually learn your posting habits. Upload new content at least once a week and do your best to stick to your posting schedule. Pick one or more days when you share videos and your followers will always know when they can expect your new content.</p><h4 id="3-Share-Your-IGTV-Videos-on-Facebook-and-Other-Social-Media"><a href="#3-Share-Your-IGTV-Videos-on-Facebook-and-Other-Social-Media" class="headerlink" title="3. Share Your IGTV Videos on Facebook and Other Social Media"></a>3. Share Your IGTV Videos on Facebook and Other Social Media</h4><p> IGTV is a relatively new platform, which means that it still doesn’t have as many users as social networks such as Facebook or Twitter. That is the reason why you shouldn’t focus exclusively on IGTV in your social media marketing efforts because you can amass a large number of followers on all popular social media platforms. Sharing an IGTV video on Facebook, for example, can help you gain access to a larger audience since you will enable your current followers to share your videos with their friends on that platform. In addition, the people who like the videos you post on your IGTV channel can become your followers, even if they found out about your IGTV channel on some other social network.</p><p> <strong>Tips and Tricks</strong> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >3 Ways to Share IGTV Videos on Facebook <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h4 id="4-Improve-the-Quality-of-the-Content-Constantly"><a href="#4-Improve-the-Quality-of-the-Content-Constantly" class="headerlink" title="4.

Improve the Quality of the Content Constantly</h4><p> Both the topics of your IGTV videos and their quality matter, so if you are just starting out you should strive to improve the overall quality of the content you post on your channel through time. Purchasing a camera that is capable of recording HD or 4K videos and all other equipment that is necessary for the production of professional-looking videos can help you capture the videos in better quality. However, the stories your videos tell are equally important, which is why you need to choose the topics of your IGTV videos carefully. Writing a script for each new IGTV video you’re planning on shooting should make it easier for you to create captivating content that is going to attract new followers.</p><h4 id="5-Interact-and-Connect-With-IGTV-Users"><a href="#5-Interact-and-Connect-With-IGTV-Users" class="headerlink" title="5.

Interact and Connect With IGTV Users</h4><p> Dedicate time to discovering the most influential IGTV users in your niche, and then make an effort to connect with them. A simple mention from someone who already has thousands of followers can do miracles for your IGTV account, which makes networking one of the most significant parts of the process of gathering new followers. Furthermore, you should reply to all the comments on your videos, and use every opportunity to interact with the followers you already have. By doing so, you will show your appreciation for the support your channel is already receiving, which may prompt some of your followers to recommend your IGTV account to their friends.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p> Each niche of IGTV videos is slightly different, and the methods you’re going to utilize to increase the number of followers you have on your channel depends on the type of content you are posting on this platform. The best time of the day to share new IGTV videos or which keywords you include in your profile depend on the audience you’re targeting, so you must do thorough research of the market before you start uploading videos to your IGTV channel.

Perhaps the most important thing is to know the audience you are targeting as it will allow you to create the content that is more appealing to the ideal viewer of your IGTV videos. Let’s have a look at a few methods you can use to get more followers on IGTV.</p><p><strong>Tips and tricks:</strong> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Converting YouTube video and Posting it on IGTV&gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h4 id="1-Optimize-Your-Profile-to-Gain-More-Followers-2"><a href="#1-Optimize-Your-Profile-to-Gain-More-Followers-2" class="headerlink" title="1.

Optimize Your Profile to Gain More Followers</h4><p> Every detail matters, from the name of your channel to the thumbnail picture you select for each of the videos you add to your IGTV channel. Putting keywords that best reflect what your business or your videos are about into your Instagram profile is important because by doing so your IGTV channel will be much easier to find. Even if you already have a big social media following, using keywords in your profile may get you a step closer to expanding the audience your IGTV videos can reach.</p><h4 id="2-Discover-the-Best-Time-to-Post-New-Videos-and-Share-New-Content-Frequently-2"><a href="#2-Discover-the-Best-Time-to-Post-New-Videos-and-Share-New-Content-Frequently-2" class="headerlink" title="2.

Discover the Best Time to Post New Videos and Share New Content Frequently</h4><p> Once again, knowing your audience and when they are the most likely to be using IGTV is essential for boosting the number of followers. The time zone in which your ideal viewer lives in or their age play an important role in choosing the time when you post new content to your IGTV channel. In general, the best time to post new videos on IGTV is from 8 p.m. to 10 p.m. from Monday to Thursday, but you should try posting at different times of the day and see what produces the best results.</p><p> Posting new videos on your IGTV channel regularly is probably more important than sharing videos at an exact same time because your followers will gradually learn your posting habits. Upload new content at least once a week and do your best to stick to your posting schedule.

Share Your IGTV Videos on Facebook and Other Social Media"></a>3. Share Your IGTV Videos on Facebook and Other Social Media</h4><p> IGTV is a relatively new platform, which means that it still doesn’t have as many users as social networks such as Facebook or Twitter. That is the reason why you shouldn’t focus exclusively on IGTV in your social media marketing efforts because you can amass a large number of followers on all popular social media platforms. Sharing an IGTV video on Facebook, for example, can help you gain access to a larger audience since you will enable your current followers to share your videos with their friends on that platform. In addition, the people who like the videos you post on your IGTV channel can become your followers, even if they found out about your IGTV channel on some other social network.</p><p> <strong>Tips and Tricks</strong> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >3 Ways to Share IGTV Videos on Facebook <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h4 id="4-Improve-the-Quality-of-the-Content-Constantly-2"><a href="#4-Improve-the-Quality-of-the-Content-Constantly-2" class="headerlink" title="4.

Purchasing a camera that is capable of recording HD or 4K videos and all other equipment that is necessary for the production of professional-looking videos can help you capture the videos in better quality. However, the stories your videos tell are equally important, which is why you need to choose the topics of your IGTV videos carefully. Writing a script for each new IGTV video you’re planning on shooting should make it easier for you to create captivating content that is going to attract new followers.</p><h4 id="5-Interact-and-Connect-With-IGTV-Users-2"><a href="#5-Interact-and-Connect-With-IGTV-Users-2" class="headerlink" title="5.

A simple mention from someone who already has thousands of followers can do miracles for your IGTV account, which makes networking one of the most significant parts of the process of gathering new followers. Furthermore, you should reply to all the comments on your videos, and use every opportunity to interact with the followers you already have. By doing so, you will show your appreciation for the support your channel is already receiving, which may prompt some of your followers to recommend your IGTV account to their friends.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p> Each niche of IGTV videos is slightly different, and the methods you’re going to utilize to increase the number of followers you have on your channel depends on the type of content you are posting on this platform.

Organize and Categorize Your Highlights Strategically"></a>1. Organize and Categorize Your Highlights Strategically</h3><p>When curating Instagram Highlights for your business account it is imperative that the content is placed in categories that are organized by their purpose.</p><p>For example, if you create a Highlight meant to showcase your hours of operation, you would <em>not</em> include a story that features new products. When your audience is looking to gain more information about your business they want to find this information with ease.</p><p>Naming your Instagram Highlight must be done strategically so that users can find what they are looking for without any guesswork. Additionally, <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >creating a cover image <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for your highlight that coincides with the content will also better suit your business account.

Showcasing Products&#x2F;Services"></a>3. Showcasing Products&#x2F;Services</h3><p>One of the most successful ways you can utilize Instagram Highlights for your business account is to showcase the product and&#x2F;or service you are selling. A Highlight specific to these items is a lot quicker and easier for your audience to digest.</p><p>This feature is particularly beneficial for e-commerce businesses. You can implement the “swipe up” feature (if you have over 10,000 followers) to take your customers directly to your product pages.

Make sure to include stories that provide the date, time and location of your event. Don’t forget that you can utilize other Instagram functions such as the “poll” to help you gain an understanding of how many people will be coming to your event.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/instagram-highlight-promote-event.jpg"                      alt="Instagram highlight promote event"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2084396/18498" target="_top" id="2084396"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2084396"                      border="0" alt="" width="1920" height="700"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2084396/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="6-Interact-with-your-Audience-3"><a href="#6-Interact-with-your-Audience-3" class="headerlink" title="6.
