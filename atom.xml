How to Upload a Video Longer than 30-Minutes to Instagram?</h2><p>Sometimes a few seconds or minutes’ videos don’t fulfill the purpose. Users like sharing every detail of the event happening around them therefore their videos may be longer than 30 minutes. Here are two easy methods to share lengthy videos with your followers.</p><ul><li>Method 1: Share a Live Video</li><li>Method 2: Use Filmora X to Reduce Video Size</li></ul><h3 id="Method-1-Share-a-Live-Video-on-Instagram"><a href="#Method-1-Share-a-Live-Video-on-Instagram" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: Share a Live Video on Instagram"></a>Method 1: Share a Live Video on Instagram</h3><p>Live videos have up to 1-hour extended video limit. Instead of recording and uploading a video as a post, you can share it as a live video instead. Since these live videos are temporary, Instagram has now introduced replays for your followers for 24 hours as soon as you finish recording them. This means your live video plays the same as an Instagram story, appearing beside the followers’ Instagram feed.</p><p>Let’s explore the steps to share a live video with friends.</p><ol><li>Swipe right from anywhere in the Feed or tap the camera icon on the top left of the screen</li><li>Click “Live” at the bottom of the screen then record</li><li>Tap Friends with smiley icons</li><li>Choose the person’s name to invite them to join your live video and add more friends accordingly</li><li>If your friends accept the invitation to join, they will appear on the split-screen view</li><li>To remove the person you’ve invited, tap “Cancel” at the top right corner of the screen</li></ol><h3 id="Method-2-Use-Filmora-X-to-Reduce-Video-Size"><a href="#Method-2-Use-Filmora-X-to-Reduce-Video-Size" class="headerlink" title="Method 2: Use Filmora X to Reduce Video Size"></a>Method 2: Use Filmora X to Reduce Video Size</h3><p>Using apps like Filmora X is one of the best ways to edit longer videos in different ways.

Also, your Instagram page should remain authentic with the message of your brand and its image.</p><h4 id="Focus-on-color-combinations-1"><a href="#Focus-on-color-combinations-1" class="headerlink" title="Focus on color combinations"></a>Focus on color combinations</h4><p>Just splitting your images into a 3x3 grid is not enough.

It might attract your audience, but you need to maintain a consistent appeal throughout your profile. To do that, you need to ensure that all the upcoming posts would follow the same pattern and appeal.</p><h4 id="Align-it-with-your-brand’s-vision-3"><a href="#Align-it-with-your-brand’s-vision-3" class="headerlink" title="Align it with your brand’s vision"></a>Align it with your brand’s vision</h4><p>Don’t come up with a grid layout for Instagram just for the sake of it. You need to make sure that it is aligned with the overall look and feel of your brand. Also, your Instagram page should remain authentic with the message of your brand and its image.</p><h4 id="Focus-on-color-combinations-3"><a href="#Focus-on-color-combinations-3" class="headerlink" title="Focus on color combinations"></a>Focus on color combinations</h4><p>Just splitting your images into a 3x3 grid is not enough.

The latest buzz on Snapchat, Instagram and Facebook are the hilarious gender swap pictures that let you see how you would look like if you were a man or a woman. However, at the moment there are only a few apps that offer gender swap effects, so you must either use Snapchat or the FaceApp to swap genders. That is why in this article we are going to show you a few different methods of creating gender swap photos with these two apps.</p><h2 id="Swapping-Gender-with-Snapchat-Filters"><a href="#Swapping-Gender-with-Snapchat-Filters" class="headerlink" title="Swapping Gender with Snapchat Filters"></a>Swapping Gender with Snapchat Filters</h2><p>Snapchat introduced three new filters that caught the attention of the crowd on social media because they highlight masculine or feminine characteristics of facial traits. The ‘man lens’ will make your jawline shaper, hair shorter and your beard longer, while the ‘woman lens’ makes your skin look softer or applies some makeup to your face. The ‘baby lens’ however, is by far the most popular of the three because it enables people to see how they would look like if they were less than six months old.</p><p>Taking a photo of yourself while any of these filters is enabled is a simple process that won’t take more than a few seconds. Launch the Snapchat app, then open the camera and switch to the phone’s front camera by tapping on the arrow icon at the top of the screen. Each of the gender swap filters should be within the top ten filters in the Snapchat’s filter collection, so just select the one you like and then take a photo. After you Tap on the Save button, the picture you’ve taken is going to be stored in the Snapchat memories.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://ursime.pxf.io/c/5597632/2092236/16384" target="_top" id="2092236"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16384-2092236"                      border="0" alt="" width="1920" height="329"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2092236/16384"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Post-Images-Taken-with-the-Gender-Swap-Snapchat-Lens-to-Instagram-or-Facebook"><a href="#Post-Images-Taken-with-the-Gender-Swap-Snapchat-Lens-to-Instagram-or-Facebook" class="headerlink" title="Post Images Taken with the Gender Swap Snapchat Lens to Instagram or Facebook"></a>Post Images Taken with the Gender Swap Snapchat Lens to Instagram or Facebook</h2><p>At the moment Instagram and Facebook don’t offer gender swap filters to its users, and if you want to post a gender swap photo on these two social media you have to take a photo with another app. Sharing a picture you’ve taken with Snapchat on Facebook, Instagram or other social media is not complicated although it requires some time and effort. Once you’ve taken the photo with the man, women or baby lens you should tap on the icon that looks like two cards that is located at the bottom of the screen and select the gender swap picture you want to share on Instagram or Facebook. Take the screenshot of the photo you selected, and save it to your phone’s Camera Roll.</p><p>Launch the Instagram app and use its photo editing tools to crop out all unwanted parts of the picture or enhance its colors. You are not going to be able to edit your gender swap photo with the Facebook app, even though you can easily share the photo on your profile. Sadly there is no indication that either Facebook or Instagram are going to introduce new gender swap filters in the near future and Snapchat is still one of your best options if you want to create this type of photos.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2087267/19272" target="_top" id="2087267"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2087267"                      border="0" alt="" width="728" height="90"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2087267/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Install-FaceApp-to-Your-iPhone-or-Android-Device"><a href="#Install-FaceApp-to-Your-iPhone-or-Android-Device" class="headerlink" title="Install FaceApp to Your iPhone or Android Device"></a>Install FaceApp to Your iPhone or Android Device</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/faceapp-change-gender.jpg"                      alt="Change Gender with FaceApp "                ></p><p>The <a class="link"   href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/faceapp-ai-face-editor/id1180884341?mt=8" >FaceApp <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a strong alternative to the newly added gender swap effects on Snapchat because it offers more gender swap filters and it makes sharing the images on Facebook or Instagram much easier. The app can be downloaded for free from the AppStore or <a class="link"   href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.faceapp&hl=en" >GooglePlay Store <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, but you must make in-app purchases if you want to unlock its Pro features. However, even the free version of the app utilizes Artificial Intelligence and neural nets to analyze a vast amount of images and use the findings to make your face look more masculine or more feminine.</p><p>The app’s users can either take new photos or edit the pictures they’ve taken with another app, but some filters are only available if you purchase a monthly or an annual subscription. The FaceApp lets you put on a new smile, swap genders or use the cool style filters to take better selfies. You can experiment with different looks and see how you’d look like if you were a Hollywood superstar or if you had a long blonde hair. Once you find the look that all of your friends must see, you can share the gender swap photo to Instagram or Facebook with a single tap.</p><p> <strong>Read More to Get :</strong> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >How to Screenshot on Snapchat without Them Knowing &gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>Taking a swap gender photo is going to cheer up your day and give your friends on social media a good laugh.

The latest buzz on Snapchat, Instagram and Facebook are the hilarious gender swap pictures that let you see how you would look like if you were a man or a woman. However, at the moment there are only a few apps that offer gender swap effects, so you must either use Snapchat or the FaceApp to swap genders. That is why in this article we are going to show you a few different methods of creating gender swap photos with these two apps.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.nero.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=22889392&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="http://webstatic.nero.com/nero2015-com-wAssets/img/affiliate/media/banner728-90eng.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Swapping-Gender-with-Snapchat-Filters-3"><a href="#Swapping-Gender-with-Snapchat-Filters-3" class="headerlink" title="Swapping Gender with Snapchat Filters"></a>Swapping Gender with Snapchat Filters</h2><p>Snapchat introduced three new filters that caught the attention of the crowd on social media because they highlight masculine or feminine characteristics of facial traits. The ‘man lens’ will make your jawline shaper, hair shorter and your beard longer, while the ‘woman lens’ makes your skin look softer or applies some makeup to your face. The ‘baby lens’ however, is by far the most popular of the three because it enables people to see how they would look like if they were less than six months old.</p><p>Taking a photo of yourself while any of these filters is enabled is a simple process that won’t take more than a few seconds. Launch the Snapchat app, then open the camera and switch to the phone’s front camera by tapping on the arrow icon at the top of the screen. Each of the gender swap filters should be within the top ten filters in the Snapchat’s filter collection, so just select the one you like and then take a photo. After you Tap on the Save button, the picture you’ve taken is going to be stored in the Snapchat memories.</p><h2 id="Post-Images-Taken-with-the-Gender-Swap-Snapchat-Lens-to-Instagram-or-Facebook-3"><a href="#Post-Images-Taken-with-the-Gender-Swap-Snapchat-Lens-to-Instagram-or-Facebook-3" class="headerlink" title="Post Images Taken with the Gender Swap Snapchat Lens to Instagram or Facebook"></a>Post Images Taken with the Gender Swap Snapchat Lens to Instagram or Facebook</h2><p>At the moment Instagram and Facebook don’t offer gender swap filters to its users, and if you want to post a gender swap photo on these two social media you have to take a photo with another app. Sharing a picture you’ve taken with Snapchat on Facebook, Instagram or other social media is not complicated although it requires some time and effort. Once you’ve taken the photo with the man, women or baby lens you should tap on the icon that looks like two cards that is located at the bottom of the screen and select the gender swap picture you want to share on Instagram or Facebook. Take the screenshot of the photo you selected, and save it to your phone’s Camera Roll.</p><p>Launch the Instagram app and use its photo editing tools to crop out all unwanted parts of the picture or enhance its colors. You are not going to be able to edit your gender swap photo with the Facebook app, even though you can easily share the photo on your profile. Sadly there is no indication that either Facebook or Instagram are going to introduce new gender swap filters in the near future and Snapchat is still one of your best options if you want to create this type of photos.</p><h2 id="Install-FaceApp-to-Your-iPhone-or-Android-Device-3"><a href="#Install-FaceApp-to-Your-iPhone-or-Android-Device-3" class="headerlink" title="Install FaceApp to Your iPhone or Android Device"></a>Install FaceApp to Your iPhone or Android Device</h2><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.iobit.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4596923&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/184260348236f9554fe9375772ff966e/ascscan_468X60.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/faceapp-change-gender.jpg"                      alt="Change Gender with FaceApp "                ></p><p>The <a class="link"   href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/faceapp-ai-face-editor/id1180884341?mt=8" >FaceApp <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a strong alternative to the newly added gender swap effects on Snapchat because it offers more gender swap filters and it makes sharing the images on Facebook or Instagram much easier. The app can be downloaded for free from the AppStore or <a class="link"   href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.faceapp&hl=en" >GooglePlay Store <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, but you must make in-app purchases if you want to unlock its Pro features. However, even the free version of the app utilizes Artificial Intelligence and neural nets to analyze a vast amount of images and use the findings to make your face look more masculine or more feminine.</p><p>The app’s users can either take new photos or edit the pictures they’ve taken with another app, but some filters are only available if you purchase a monthly or an annual subscription. The FaceApp lets you put on a new smile, swap genders or use the cool style filters to take better selfies. You can experiment with different looks and see how you’d look like if you were a Hollywood superstar or if you had a long blonde hair. Once you find the look that all of your friends must see, you can share the gender swap photo to Instagram or Facebook with a single tap.</p><p> <strong>Read More to Get :</strong> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >How to Screenshot on Snapchat without Them Knowing &gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>Taking a swap gender photo is going to cheer up your day and give your friends on social media a good laugh.

Perfect caption helps in shaping a personality and increases more followers too. Before writing Instagram captions, you need to be aware of some of the writing tips to create a strong writing base.</p><p>Here are some of the informative tips you need to keep in mind while writing Instagram captions.</p><h4 id="Be-Natural-3"><a href="#Be-Natural-3" class="headerlink" title="Be Natural"></a>Be Natural</h4><p>While thinking of any Instagram captions most important thing is to be authentic. In any kind of content try to be real and put yourself out in front of viewers. Try to be human, you don’t sound like a robot. You may feel like being extra but being natural would make more sense.</p><h4 id="Add-some-breaks-to-longer-captions-3"><a href="#Add-some-breaks-to-longer-captions-3" class="headerlink" title="Add some breaks to longer captions"></a>Add some breaks to longer captions</h4><p>Keeping short and on point, the Instagram caption is the best way of expressing yourself. But sometimes you feel like adding some extra elements and talk about a bit more too. Then you need to ensure that you are keeping some necessary breaks while writing a long caption just to make it look lighter to viewers. You don’t want to bore users by seeing at the length only right!</p><h4 id="Include-catchy-emoji-3"><a href="#Include-catchy-emoji-3" class="headerlink" title="Include catchy emoji"></a>Include catchy emoji</h4><p>Try inserting necessary emoji while writing your captions to create an appeal for your viewers. We all love emojis and adding them in an Instagram caption would make it look a little extra too.</p><h4 id="Make-use-of-the-right-hashtags-3"><a href="#Make-use-of-the-right-hashtags-3" class="headerlink" title="Make use of the right hashtags"></a>Make use of the right hashtags</h4><p>Keep in mind that you want your Instagram posts to gain maximum views and make them searchable too. One of the effective ways to do that is to use relevant hashtags depending upon your Instagram post. Try to be strategic with the hashtags and add the top-rated ones to engage with more people.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4665597&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.pcclean.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/winutilities-box-130521.png"                      border="0"                >WinUtilities Pro</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Conclusion-3"><a href="#Conclusion-3" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>So Nowadays along with the picture upload adding a sparkling touch with the help of Instagram caption is the trend that you don’t want to miss trying too.

The ability to connect, learn, share and sell on Instagram is limitless, but those who achieve the greatest success do so by exploiting every feature the app has to offer.

For business accounts, think of the Instagram Highlights as a specifically curated folder where your audience can find all the information they need in an organized manner. The better curated your Highlights, the more your audience can understand who you are and what you do or sell.</p><h3 id="1-Organize-and-Categorize-Your-Highlights-Strategically"><a href="#1-Organize-and-Categorize-Your-Highlights-Strategically" class="headerlink" title="1. Organize and Categorize Your Highlights Strategically"></a>1. Organize and Categorize Your Highlights Strategically</h3><p>When curating Instagram Highlights for your business account it is imperative that the content is placed in categories that are organized by their purpose.</p><p>For example, if you create a Highlight meant to showcase your hours of operation, you would <em>not</em> include a story that features new products. When your audience is looking to gain more information about your business they want to find this information with ease.</p><p>Naming your Instagram Highlight must be done strategically so that users can find what they are looking for without any guesswork. Additionally, <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >creating a cover image <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for your highlight that coincides with the content will also better suit your business account. Instagram celebrates the visual learners in all of us, use that to your advantage.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.revouninstaller.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=27889512&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/4282ec8de8c9be897e7aff4aa231b1a4/728__90.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="2-Keep-it-Concise"><a href="#2-Keep-it-Concise" class="headerlink" title="2.

Wow! 100 stories!?</p><p>It seems great, that is until you remember how small of a window you have to capture a potential customer&#x2F;buyer. While some Highlight categories might call for more content, be sure to pick the most important, eye-catching and engaging stories to feature.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.advancedwebranking.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4715051&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/14edc6ebfdae2e23bbed83d67f50e983/products/33_awr%20logo.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="3-Showcasing-Products-Services"><a href="#3-Showcasing-Products-Services" class="headerlink" title="3.

Showcasing Products&#x2F;Services</h3><p>One of the most successful ways you can utilize Instagram Highlights for your business account is to showcase the product and&#x2F;or service you are selling. A Highlight specific to these items is a lot quicker and easier for your audience to digest.</p><p>This feature is particularly beneficial for e-commerce businesses. You can implement the “swipe up” feature (if you have over 10,000 followers) to take your customers directly to your product pages. Products can also be tagged and take users to your Instagram Shop!</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://bluettius.sjv.io/c/5597632/2027209/17108" target="_top" id="2027209"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17108-2027209"                      border="0" alt="" width="300" height="250"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2027209/17108"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/instagram-story-highlight-show-product.jpg"                      alt="Instagram highlight show product"                ></p><h3 id="4-Make-Company-Announcements"><a href="#4-Make-Company-Announcements" class="headerlink" title="4. Make Company Announcements"></a>4. Make Company Announcements</h3><p>Having a Highlight to feature company&#x2F;business announcements is a great way for your audience to stay up to date with what you have going on.</p><p>Maybe your business is hiring, opening a new storefront, or featuring star employees. This is the place to house that content. While it may seem difficult to make people care about updates and announcements to your business, you can curate content for this Highlight in a way that engages your audience.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/instagram-highlight-company-announcement.jpg"                      alt="Instagram highlight company announcement"                ></p><h3 id="5-Promote-Events"><a href="#5-Promote-Events" class="headerlink" title="5. Promote Events"></a>5. Promote Events</h3><p>Using Instagram to promote your event is a great way to build awareness and gauge interest from your audience.</p><p>Because the story feature only operates for 24 hours, having a Highlight for an upcoming event allows people to view the information for as long as you make it viewable. Make sure to include stories that provide the date, time and location of your event. Don’t forget that you can utilize other Instagram functions such as the “poll” to help you gain an understanding of how many people will be coming to your event.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/instagram-highlight-promote-event.jpg"                      alt="Instagram highlight promote event"                ></p><h3 id="6-Interact-with-your-Audience"><a href="#6-Interact-with-your-Audience" class="headerlink" title="6.

But don’t limit these interactions to 24 hours. By including an interactive Highlight on your business Instagram, you can learn all kinds of things about your customers.</p><p>Another key interaction tool that would help boost your business account is the question feature. This feature allows you to ask your audience questions and get their feedback in real time. Their responses will be sent directly to your Direct Message box.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://estore.winxdvd.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4612444&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.winxdvd.com/affiliate/new-banner/pt-728x90.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/interact-with-audience-instagram-highlight.jpg"                      alt="Instagram highlight interact with audience"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2095369/26400" target="_top" id="2095369"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2095369"                      border="0" alt="" width="1024" height="512"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2095369/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="7-Answer-Frequently-Asked-Questions-FAQ"><a href="#7-Answer-Frequently-Asked-Questions-FAQ" class="headerlink" title="7.

Answer Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h3><p>Instead of leaving things up to the imagination, or having your audience sort through pages to find the answer to their question, creating an FAQ Highlight on your account can help your audience better understand important details about your business.</p><p>Don’t hesitate to include basic information in your FAQ highlight. You’d be surprised how the easiest of details can be forgotten. Try including the question feature as one of your slides, so that users can submit questions they have that you can include in the Highlight moving forward.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/instagram-frequently-asked-question.jpg"                      alt="Instagram highlight  usage - show faq"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://funwhole.sjv.io/c/5597632/1702887/17189" target="_top" id="1702887"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17189-1702887"                      border="0" alt="" width="1000" height="1000"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1702887/17189"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="8-How-To-Guides"><a href="#8-How-To-Guides" class="headerlink" title="8. How-To Guides"></a>8. How-To Guides</h3><p>If your product requires assembly or tips for use, consider creating a Highlight that shows customers how to use or build your product. Showing your customers the proper way to use your product will help instill trust in your brand. This is especially important if the product you are selling is on the high-end spectrum. If potential buyers can see the outcome of the product once put together or used, they might be more inclined to purchase from you.</p><h3 id="9-Showcase-Reviews-Testimonials"><a href="#9-Showcase-Reviews-Testimonials" class="headerlink" title="9. Showcase Reviews&#x2F;Testimonials"></a>9. Showcase Reviews&#x2F;Testimonials</h3><p>Nothing helps the buyer’s decision more than seeing other happy customers. There is great value in showing love and support for your product, so don’t hesitate to highlight this in a Highlight. While tip #2 stated the importance of being concise, this is one highlight we recommend you make as long as possible. The more positive testimonials and reviews you can promote, the more trustworthy your brand becomes.</p><h3 id="10-Share-Promotions-Deals"><a href="#10-Share-Promotions-Deals" class="headerlink" title="10. Share Promotions&#x2F;Deals"></a>10. Share Promotions&#x2F;Deals</h3><p>The final tip we’d like to share is using Instagram Highlights to share any promotions or deals you are offering.</p><p>Boosting sales on Instagram is a great way to attract new business and followers. Offering deals to new and existing customers prompts users to interact with your business and generate sales. Running a giveaway on your Instagram can also help build your following.

Products can also be tagged and take users to your Instagram Shop!</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://dhgate.sjv.io/c/5597632/1678785/12108" target="_top" id="1678785"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/12108-1678785"                      border="0" alt="" width="300" height="250"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/instagram-story-highlight-show-product.jpg"                      alt="Instagram highlight show product"                ></p><h3 id="4-Make-Company-Announcements-3"><a href="#4-Make-Company-Announcements-3" class="headerlink" title="4.

This is the place to house that content. While it may seem difficult to make people care about updates and announcements to your business, you can curate content for this Highlight in a way that engages your audience.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.manycam.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=17729331&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/8230bea7d54bcdf99cdfe85cb07313d5/mcaffbanner600x500.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/instagram-highlight-company-announcement.jpg"                      alt="Instagram highlight company announcement"                ></p><h3 id="5-Promote-Events-3"><a href="#5-Promote-Events-3" class="headerlink" title="5.

Promote Events</h3><p>Using Instagram to promote your event is a great way to build awareness and gauge interest from your audience.</p><p>Because the story feature only operates for 24 hours, having a Highlight for an upcoming event allows people to view the information for as long as you make it viewable. Make sure to include stories that provide the date, time and location of your event. Don’t forget that you can utilize other Instagram functions such as the “poll” to help you gain an understanding of how many people will be coming to your event.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/instagram-highlight-promote-event.jpg"                      alt="Instagram highlight promote event"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://estore.zonealarm.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=38658749&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://sc1.checkpoint.com/sc1/za/images/boxes/pa_500.png"                      border="0"                >ZoneAlarm Pro Antivirus + Firewall NextGen</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="6-Interact-with-your-Audience-3"><a href="#6-Interact-with-your-Audience-3" class="headerlink" title="6.

By including an interactive Highlight on your business Instagram, you can learn all kinds of things about your customers.</p><p>Another key interaction tool that would help boost your business account is the question feature.

Answer Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h3><p>Instead of leaving things up to the imagination, or having your audience sort through pages to find the answer to their question, creating an FAQ Highlight on your account can help your audience better understand important details about your business.</p><p>Don’t hesitate to include basic information in your FAQ highlight. You’d be surprised how the easiest of details can be forgotten. Try including the question feature as one of your slides, so that users can submit questions they have that you can include in the Highlight moving forward.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/instagram-frequently-asked-question.jpg"                      alt="Instagram highlight  usage - show faq"                ></p><h3 id="8-How-To-Guides-3"><a href="#8-How-To-Guides-3" class="headerlink" title="8.

Showing your customers the proper way to use your product will help instill trust in your brand. This is especially important if the product you are selling is on the high-end spectrum. If potential buyers can see the outcome of the product once put together or used, they might be more inclined to purchase from you.</p><h3 id="9-Showcase-Reviews-Testimonials-3"><a href="#9-Showcase-Reviews-Testimonials-3" class="headerlink" title="9.

There is great value in showing love and support for your product, so don’t hesitate to highlight this in a Highlight. While tip #2 stated the importance of being concise, this is one highlight we recommend you make as long as possible. The more positive testimonials and reviews you can promote, the more trustworthy your brand becomes.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=37540879&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://paperscan.orpalis.com/img/content/You_prefer_to_use.png"                      border="0"                >PaperScan Professional： PaperScan Scanner Software is a powerful TWAIN &amp; WIA scanning application centered on one idea: making document acquisition an unparalleled easy task for anyone.</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="10-Share-Promotions-Deals-3"><a href="#10-Share-Promotions-Deals-3" class="headerlink" title="10.

Coming up with new topics for photos that will keep your followers interested and entertained is essential if you want your Instagram profile to attract thousands of likes on a daily basis.</p><p> We’ve gathered some ideas that might inspire you to create photos that will take Instagram by storm, so let’s start discovering different ways of keeping your followers interested while attracting the attention of new Instagrammers.</p><h2 id="Top-20-Inspiring-Instagram-Photos-Ideas"><a href="#Top-20-Inspiring-Instagram-Photos-Ideas" class="headerlink" title="Top 20 Inspiring Instagram Photos Ideas"></a>Top 20 Inspiring Instagram Photos Ideas</h2><p> Keeping an open mind and approaching each idea with a fresh pair of eyes will help you achieve better results, whichever idea from the list below you choose to explore.</p><ul><li><strong>Cityscapes and Landscapes</strong></li></ul><p> There is absolutely no doubt that people love beautiful landscapes, and they often don’t feel shy about showing it. The same goes for gorgeous city scenes captured on rainy nights or early in the morning on your way to work.</p><ul><li><strong>Inspirational Quotes</strong></li></ul><p> Life can be hard, and we all look for inspiration wherever we can find it. Posting inspirational quotes on your Instagram profile can be a great way to inspire others, especially if you post quotes that are directly related to the topic your profile is covering.</p><ul><li><strong>Combine several photos into a single Instagram post</strong></li></ul><p> A picture is worth a thousand words, but not all stories can be told with a single picture. Combining a few photos that tell the stories you want your followers to see, can be a very efficient way of promoting your products or letting your friends know about your latest adventure.</p><ul><li><strong>Selfies</strong></li></ul><p> Selfies have lost a lot of the popularity they had a couple of years ago, but this doesn’t mean that taking a creative selfie on an amazing location isn’t an awesome Instagram photo idea.</p><ul><li><strong>Important events from your life</strong></li></ul><p> Graduating from college, getting the first job, being promoted or moving to another country are all important steps in life, and sharing them with your friends on Instagram will surely help you get a lot of likes.</p><ul><li><strong>Animals doing adorable things</strong></li></ul><p> Pets are like children, we all get attached to them pretty quickly, so why not introduce your furry companions to the Instagram community. Besides, you’ll probably be able to get some amazing shots just by paying attention to the day your pet is having.</p><ul><li><strong>Animate your Instagram profile with Boomerang</strong></li></ul><p> The Instagram’s Boomerang feature is fun to use because it brings a motion to otherwise mostly static profile. The best part is that Boomerang can be used both for professional purposes and entertainment, with an equal amount of success.</p><ul><li><strong>Product Shots</strong></li></ul><p> Online entrepreneurs, as well as big companies, can use Instagram photos as a creative way of familiarizing their potential clients with products and services they are offering. Posting pictures on Instagram should be a part of every online marketing campaign because you never know who is going to stumble upon your photo.</p><ul><li><strong>Hilarious GIFs</strong></li></ul><p> People never forget how you made them feel, so making them laugh is always a good idea. GIFs are incredibly popular and very easy to make, so using your creative energy to cheer up your business associates and friends may help you increase traffic on your Instagram profile. However, you’ll need to have an app that enables you to post GIFs to Instagram, since the platform doesn’t support GIF files.</p><ul><li><strong>Delicious Food</strong></li></ul><p> We all love to eat, which is why pics of delicious food are never a bad idea. However, it goes without saying that taking a photo of every snack you lay your eyes on should probably be avoided . Post only food pics that offer something more than a view of a spaghetti bowl.</p><ul><li><strong>Yoga Poses</strong></li></ul><p> Taking care of your body means that you are taking care of your mind. Yoga is currently one of the most popular recreational activities in the world, and if you know a few good Yoga poses you shouldn’t hesitate to share them.</p><ul><li><strong>Photos of a venue</strong></li></ul><p> This Instagram photo idea works best for cafes, bars or restaurants, although all other types of venues can spark a lot of interest. What’s more, musicians who are playing at several different places in a single week can use these types of shots to promote their gigs.</p><ul><li><strong>Close-up shots</strong></li></ul><p> You can take close-ups of literally anything, however, it is important to take these types of shot in situations that are somehow related to the most important subjects your Instagram account covers. Close-ups are a great choice if you want to appear professional, and add an artistic touch to your Instagram photos.</p><ul><li><strong>Take shots that show your thankfulness</strong></li></ul><p> Show how much you appreciate the support your followers are giving you. You’ll make them feel involved and as a part of the success, your Instagram profile is enjoying.</p><ul><li><strong>A sneak peek of a new project you’re working on</strong></li></ul><p> Nothing sparks interest like a sneak peek shot of a project you are just starting. This Instagram photo idea is a perfect bait for comments and is best used if you want to promote your upcoming project.</p><ul><li><strong>Tell your Instagram followers all about your hobby</strong></li></ul><p> Make things personal, and let your friends know how you like to spend your free time. Hiking, making origami sculptures or reading make great topics for photos, and they give your followers an insight into your life.</p><ul><li><strong>Offer a good tip</strong></li></ul><p> Life hacks can be precious because they offer us a faster and simpler way of doing things. Even if you made a horrible mistake, offering a useful tip will prevent your followers from repeating the same mistake and offer them a way to improve their lives.</p><ul><li><strong>Explore new angles</strong></li></ul><p> Sometimes all we need is a fresh approach to things. The same can be said for Instagram photo ideas because just changing the angle from which you take photos can offer a new perspective on the topic you are covering.</p><ul><li><strong>Show the world what you really stand for</strong></li></ul><p> Sharing corporate values or standing up for the causes you really believe in can get you a lot of sympathy on Instagram. Take photos that reflect the values you stand for, and you’ll see how many people share the same values.</p><ul><li><strong>Share your achievements</strong></li></ul><p> Nothing motivates like success since we all love to watch success stories unfold in front of our eyes. Each of your achievements can inspire others to do great things, so don’t hesitate to use them as an idea for your Instagram photos.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.massmailsoftware.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=1095219&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/dc87c13749315c7217cdc4ac692e704c/banera_for_partners-20_%281%29.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shannon-cox.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Shanoon Cox</p><p>Shanoon Cox is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Shanoon Cox</p><h5 id="Shanoon-Cox-1"><a href="#Shanoon-Cox-1" class="headerlink" title="Shanoon Cox"></a>Shanoon Cox</h5><p> Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions</p><p> Posting new photos to Instagram every day can dry up your pool of ideas pretty quickly.

The same goes for gorgeous city scenes captured on rainy nights or early in the morning on your way to work.</p><ul><li><strong>Inspirational Quotes</strong></li></ul><p> Life can be hard, and we all look for inspiration wherever we can find it. Posting inspirational quotes on your Instagram profile can be a great way to inspire others, especially if you post quotes that are directly related to the topic your profile is covering.</p><ul><li><strong>Combine several photos into a single Instagram post</strong></li></ul><p> A picture is worth a thousand words, but not all stories can be told with a single picture. Combining a few photos that tell the stories you want your followers to see, can be a very efficient way of promoting your products or letting your friends know about your latest adventure.</p><ul><li><strong>Selfies</strong></li></ul><p> Selfies have lost a lot of the popularity they had a couple of years ago, but this doesn’t mean that taking a creative selfie on an amazing location isn’t an awesome Instagram photo idea.</p><ul><li><strong>Important events from your life</strong></li></ul><p> Graduating from college, getting the first job, being promoted or moving to another country are all important steps in life, and sharing them with your friends on Instagram will surely help you get a lot of likes.</p><ul><li><strong>Animals doing adorable things</strong></li></ul><p> Pets are like children, we all get attached to them pretty quickly, so why not introduce your furry companions to the Instagram community. Besides, you’ll probably be able to get some amazing shots just by paying attention to the day your pet is having.</p><ul><li><strong>Animate your Instagram profile with Boomerang</strong></li></ul><p> The Instagram’s Boomerang feature is fun to use because it brings a motion to otherwise mostly static profile. The best part is that Boomerang can be used both for professional purposes and entertainment, with an equal amount of success.</p><ul><li><strong>Product Shots</strong></li></ul><p> Online entrepreneurs, as well as big companies, can use Instagram photos as a creative way of familiarizing their potential clients with products and services they are offering. Posting pictures on Instagram should be a part of every online marketing campaign because you never know who is going to stumble upon your photo.</p><ul><li><strong>Hilarious GIFs</strong></li></ul><p> People never forget how you made them feel, so making them laugh is always a good idea. GIFs are incredibly popular and very easy to make, so using your creative energy to cheer up your business associates and friends may help you increase traffic on your Instagram profile. However, you’ll need to have an app that enables you to post GIFs to Instagram, since the platform doesn’t support GIF files.</p><ul><li><strong>Delicious Food</strong></li></ul><p> We all love to eat, which is why pics of delicious food are never a bad idea. However, it goes without saying that taking a photo of every snack you lay your eyes on should probably be avoided . Post only food pics that offer something more than a view of a spaghetti bowl.</p><ul><li><strong>Yoga Poses</strong></li></ul><p> Taking care of your body means that you are taking care of your mind.

Facebook’s servers store all the images and their digital imprints in highly encrypted form. Therefore, finding the user’s profile using a photo is not a convenient method. Contrary to Facebook, where you can find a user’s profile by using the unique Image ID of images downloaded from their site.

Since its inception, Instagram has grown in popularity as a method to engage with brands, celebrities, thought leaders, friends, family, and more. The launch of Instagram’s IGTv function was a great success, and the platform isn’t stopping there. Soon later, in the summer of 2019, Instagram added a new feature: you may now video chat with one or more of your friends in direct messaging without having to leave Instagram. This innovation will help Instagram to retain its users on the platform for longer than before, obviating the need for third-party programs such as Skype and Facetime.</p><h4 id="In-this-article"><a href="#In-this-article" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 <a href="#part1">What Is The Most Important Information You Should Know About Instagram?</a></p><p>02 <a href="#part2">How To Use Instagram Video Chat?</a></p><p>03 <a href="#part3">Things You Should Pay Attention To While Using Youtube Video Chat</a></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4718728&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/ce9a6fb2becc2d235e62b125e9260102/products/vMixCallScreenshot1-large.jpg"                      border="0"                > vMix Basic HD - Software based live production. vMix Basic HD includes 4 inputs, 3 cameras, streaming, recording, playlist.<br>This bundle includes Studio 200 for vMix from Virtualsetworks, HTTP Matrix 1.0 automation scheduler, and 4 introductory training videos from the Udemy vMix Basic to Amazing course. </a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="What-Is-The-Most-Important-Information-You-Should-Know-About-Instagram"><a href="#What-Is-The-Most-Important-Information-You-Should-Know-About-Instagram" class="headerlink" title="What Is The Most Important Information You Should Know About Instagram?"></a>What Is The Most Important Information You Should Know About Instagram?</h2><p>Instagram is a photo and video-sharing social networking platform with a smartphone app. You may create, modify, and share visual content so that your followers can interact with it through likes, comments</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://estore.winxdvd.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4612444&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.winxdvd.com/affiliate/new-banner/pt-728x90.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/instagram-video-chat-1.jpg"                      alt="instgram video chat"                ></p><h4 id="When-Is-It-Introduced"><a href="#When-Is-It-Introduced" class="headerlink" title="When Is It Introduced?"></a>When Is It Introduced?</h4><p>Instagram is the most popular social networking platform in the world. It was a huge hit right away, with over a million users only two months after it went up. Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger created Instagram in San Francisco.</p><p>Instagram was started on October 6, 2010, and it grew almost instantly. From a small number of users, it quickly grew to become the most popular photography app, with 100,000 users in one week and one million in two months. According to Kevin Systrom, the software took only eight weeks to develop yet was the culmination of a year’s worth of work. Facebook eventually purchased it for $1 billion in 2012. It now has over 600 million active users and continues to grow rapidly.</p><h4 id="How-Many-People-Can-You-Video-Chat-With"><a href="#How-Many-People-Can-You-Video-Chat-With" class="headerlink" title="How Many People Can You Video Chat With?"></a>How Many People Can You Video Chat With?</h4><p>Instagram is one of the most popular social media platforms, with millions of users regularly. Users can share their photos, stories, and other content with their followers on a private or public account.

So that you may keep in touch with your friends, family, and teammates. The best part is that you don’t need a phone number to make an Instagram video call; all you need is excellent Internet access. You can even invite someone to join a video chat that is already in progress.</p><p>Now, if you’re wondering how many individuals you can video chat with, the answer is, Instagram allows you to video chat with up to 6 people.</p><h4 id="Will-Instagram-Video-Chat-Show-Your-Face"><a href="#Will-Instagram-Video-Chat-Show-Your-Face" class="headerlink" title="Will Instagram Video Chat Show Your Face?"></a>Will Instagram Video Chat Show Your Face?</h4><p>If you’re in an Instagram Direct group discussion and there’s an active Video Chat, the camera icon in the top-right corner of your thread will become blue.

Remember that when you minimize a Video Chat, you will be the only one who can see what’s on your screen!

We expect businesses to experiment with using video chat to communicate with customers as Instagram develops. It can undoubtedly become a new approach to communicating with your followers to keep them involved and satisfied with your services.</p><p><strong>●</strong> Keep in mind that anyone who has sent you a direct message can video chat with you. You can easily block or mute someone who is video chatting with you to prevent them from doing so. Video conferencing is ideal for groups. You can video chat with your buddies for as long as you want if you have a good internet connection. Simply tap the red phone icon at the bottom of the screen to exit the video conversation.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Instagram is a free photo and video-sharing social networking platform.

These will be the posts from people who you are not following but might interest you. Although many people are happy with this new feature because it kind of markets you so that other people can start following; however, people who repeatedly see suggested posts aren’t really happy about it.</p><p>The reason? These people aren’t interested in seeing random people’s posts on their feed. If you feel the same and want to know <strong>how to turn off suggested posts on Instagram,</strong> you have come to the right place.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: What is Instagram Suggested?</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 2: How to Turn off Suggested Posts on Instagram?</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Part 3: How to Delete Suggested Users from Instagram?</a></li><li><a href="#part4">Part 4: How to Avoid Showing up in Other Users’ Suggestions for Your List?</a></li><li><a href="#part5">Part 5: How Does Instagram Suggestions Work?</a></li></ul><hr><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://coinrule.sjv.io/c/5597632/1958374/18409" target="_top" id="1958374"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18409-1958374"                      border="0" alt="" width="300" height="300"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1958374/18409"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Instagram-Suggested"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Instagram-Suggested" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is Instagram Suggested?"></a>Part 1: What is Instagram Suggested?</h2><p>Instagram is working on its features and has recently rolled out the new feature called suggested posts. When Instagram suggests something on its own, it will be basically posts of random people who Instagram thinks you might be interested in checking out. These posts will appear when you reach the end of your feed.</p><p>Also, these posts will be based on what you prefer to see on Instagram, in general. If you are whether these will be the same as the ones that show up in explore, then no, they won’t be that. These posts will be related to the ones that you already follow or often browse through.</p><p>Suggested posts will let you scroll through Instagram a bit more and even give you a chance to follow the person you don’t follow. Along with suggested posts, there is another feature called suggested friends. You will see this right after you see the first or second posts.</p><p>The intent of these features is to know more like-minded people and follow them to see more of their posts.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Turn-off-Suggested-Posts-on-Instagram"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Turn-off-Suggested-Posts-on-Instagram" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Turn off Suggested Posts on Instagram?"></a>Part 2: How to Turn off Suggested Posts on Instagram?</h2><p>So, if you are searching for answers to <strong>remove suggested posts on Instagram,</strong> here comes upsetting news, and that’s there is no direct way to stop seeing unwanted suggested posts right at the bottom of the feed. Instagram has also made it clear that there is no way one can close suggested posts. However, this certainly doesn’t mean that you can hide suggested posts at all.</p><p>And to do that, all you will have to do is make your account private. Once you do that, you will only be seeing posts on your feed of the people that you follow.</p><p>Here’s what you need to do:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open your Instagram account and if you are not logged in, simply enter your credentials to log in. You can do this by visiting your Instagram mobile app or via the browser. Once your account is open, instead of going to your profile, stay on the home page, which shows you the latest posts of people you are following.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=30901369&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/ce9a6fb2becc2d235e62b125e9260102/products/1_copy_vMixCallScreenshot1-large.jpg"                      border="0"                > vMix 4K - Software based live production. vMix 4K includes everything in vMix HD plus 4K support, PTZ control, External&#x2F;Fullscreen output, 4 Virtual Outputs, 1 Replay, 4 vMix Call, and 2 Recorders.<br>This bundle includes Studio 200 for vMix from Virtualsetworks, HTTP Matrix 1.0 automation scheduler, and 4 introductory training videos from the Udemy vMix Basic to Amazing course. </a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/instagram-suggestions-for-you.jpg"                      alt=" suggestions for you on Ins"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Go to the home page, where you can see posts of the people you follow. Now, scroll down towards the end and stop when you see the “you’re all caught up” message.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Right below that, you will see Suggested Posts, and the whole section will be filled with posts of people you don’t know.</p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Now, to stop seeing a recommended user’s post, you can click on the three dots.

From analysing the posts, you follow, like, and comment on, Instagram tries to show you the best recommendations so that you can have a better user experience. The new feature that it has rolled out is the suggestions. The way suggestions work is quite simple.</p><p>The algorithm shows you suggestions based on your taste, the accounts you follow, and what you often browse through. This can be suggested users and suggested posts. Even if you keep your account private, you will still see the suggested posts, although suggested users will not appear. Instagram will keep track of what you like to see and explore, and based on that; the algorithm sends you suggestions that it thinks you will be interested in.</p><p>For example, let’s say you like to watch cats and dogs’ videos, so once you are done checking out the feed, towards the bottom, it will say “you’re all caught up,” and then it will start showing suggested posts of cats and dogs because you have checked similar content before.</p><p>So, based on that, it will start recommending posts and people that offer similar content. This encourages users to follow new people and stay updated with their latest posts. In addition to this, Instagram will also track the kind of hashtags you use, the posts that you have liked or commented on, and things like these.</p><p>So, even if you clear your search history, you will still end up seeing these posts. A user name will stop appearing if they go to their settings page and check out similar account suggestions. But most users don’t do that; hence, you will see their posts. Another thing to note is that these suggestions can be based on your Facebook friends as well because Facebook owns Instagram.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>So, now you know <strong>how to remove suggested posts on Instagram feed</strong> and how to go about it. Remember that Instagram suggested posts is a new feature, and there’s no way to delete this feature completely. You can certainly remove the suggested posts or suggested users, but you can’t completely remove suggested posts and users completely. However, this feature is quite handy because it lets you explore more content easily without going through the search tab.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mondly.com%3FAFFILIATE%3D108875%26RESOURCE%3D%2BBusiness%2B970x90%2B"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/69c418c33ec2e1a4267fa9bb77fa1428/business-970x90.gif"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shannon-cox.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Shanoon Cox</p><p>Shanoon Cox is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Shanoon Cox</p><h5 id="Shanoon-Cox-1"><a href="#Shanoon-Cox-1" class="headerlink" title="Shanoon Cox"></a>Shanoon Cox</h5><p> Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions</p><p>How to Turn off Suggested Posts on Instagram?</p><p>If you are an Instagram user, you might have seen something called a suggested post in your feed. These will be the posts from people who you are not following but might interest you. Although many people are happy with this new feature because it kind of markets you so that other people can start following; however, people who repeatedly see suggested posts aren’t really happy about it.</p><p>The reason? These people aren’t interested in seeing random people’s posts on their feed.

When Instagram suggests something on its own, it will be basically posts of random people who Instagram thinks you might be interested in checking out. These posts will appear when you reach the end of your feed.</p><p>Also, these posts will be based on what you prefer to see on Instagram, in general. If you are whether these will be the same as the ones that show up in explore, then no, they won’t be that. These posts will be related to the ones that you already follow or often browse through.</p><p>Suggested posts will let you scroll through Instagram a bit more and even give you a chance to follow the person you don’t follow. Along with suggested posts, there is another feature called suggested friends. You will see this right after you see the first or second posts.</p><p>The intent of these features is to know more like-minded people and follow them to see more of their posts.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://thefitville.pxf.io/c/5597632/1526796/15852" target="_top" id="1526796"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/15852-1526796"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="628"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1526796/15852"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Turn-off-Suggested-Posts-on-Instagram-1"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Turn-off-Suggested-Posts-on-Instagram-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Turn off Suggested Posts on Instagram?"></a>Part 2: How to Turn off Suggested Posts on Instagram?</h2><p>So, if you are searching for answers to <strong>remove suggested posts on Instagram,</strong> here comes upsetting news, and that’s there is no direct way to stop seeing unwanted suggested posts right at the bottom of the feed.

Please click on that, and then click on the Settings option.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Scroll down towards the bottom, and you will find the similar account suggestions section.

From analysing the posts, you follow, like, and comment on, Instagram tries to show you the best recommendations so that you can have a better user experience. The new feature that it has rolled out is the suggestions. The way suggestions work is quite simple.</p><p>The algorithm shows you suggestions based on your taste, the accounts you follow, and what you often browse through. This can be suggested users and suggested posts. Even if you keep your account private, you will still see the suggested posts, although suggested users will not appear. Instagram will keep track of what you like to see and explore, and based on that; the algorithm sends you suggestions that it thinks you will be interested in.</p><p>For example, let’s say you like to watch cats and dogs’ videos, so once you are done checking out the feed, towards the bottom, it will say “you’re all caught up,” and then it will start showing suggested posts of cats and dogs because you have checked similar content before.</p><p>So, based on that, it will start recommending posts and people that offer similar content. This encourages users to follow new people and stay updated with their latest posts. In addition to this, Instagram will also track the kind of hashtags you use, the posts that you have liked or commented on, and things like these.</p><p>So, even if you clear your search history, you will still end up seeing these posts. A user name will stop appearing if they go to their settings page and check out similar account suggestions. But most users don’t do that; hence, you will see their posts. Another thing to note is that these suggestions can be based on your Facebook friends as well because Facebook owns Instagram.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>So, now you know <strong>how to remove suggested posts on Instagram feed</strong> and how to go about it. Remember that Instagram suggested posts is a new feature, and there’s no way to delete this feature completely. You can certainly remove the suggested posts or suggested users, but you can’t completely remove suggested posts and users completely.

Once your account is open, instead of going to your profile, stay on the home page, which shows you the latest posts of people you are following.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/instagram-suggestions-for-you.jpg"                      alt=" suggestions for you on Ins"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Go to the home page, where you can see posts of the people you follow. Now, scroll down towards the end and stop when you see the “you’re all caught up” message.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Right below that, you will see Suggested Posts, and the whole section will be filled with posts of people you don’t know.</p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Now, to stop seeing a recommended user’s post, you can click on the three dots. The dots will be towards the right of the user’s name.</p><p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Four options will be shown to you- report, not interested, copy URL, and finally, share. You need to click on the not interesting option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/instagram-suggestion-posts-options.jpg"                      alt="click on not interested on suggested posts"                ></p><p><strong>Step 6:</strong> That post and user will be removed, and instead of that, you will see a message by Instagram asking for feedback. You can click on the option: I don’t want to see posts from this account, and Instagram won’t show you that user’s posts.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/instagram-suggestion-posts-feedback.jpg"                      alt="choose your feedback option"                ></p><p>Now, you can apply the same steps for the rest of the posts as well. But do keep in mind that suggested posts will still appear. And you will have to apply this setting for each one so that you are shown fewer posts of unknown people.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://purchase.swifdoo.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=38709260&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/8b932759a5a04ddb34bf79e3f9072e4b/products/Product%20box%20white-1024x1024.png"                      border="0"                >SwifDoo PDF Perpetual (2-PC)  Free upgrade. No monthly fees ever. </a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Delete-Suggested-Users-from-Instagram-3"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Delete-Suggested-Users-from-Instagram-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Delete Suggested Users from Instagram?"></a>Part 3: How to Delete Suggested Users from Instagram?</h2><p>If you don’t want to see suggested users on your Instagram feed, there is a way to remove unknown users actually. You can do it by using your web browser or Instagram mobile app. Whichever is comfortable to use. However, please note that these steps have to be followed for each suggested user. Now, please use that and then follow these steps.</p><h3 id="For-Instagram-app-users-3"><a href="#For-Instagram-app-users-3" class="headerlink" title="For Instagram app users"></a>For Instagram app users</h3><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> First, you need to open your Instagram account on your handset.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Start looking at your Instagram feed. After one or two posts, you will see the Suggestions for You feature. Take a look at the screenshot to understand better.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Now, on top of every suggestion for you, you will see the x mark. That’s what you need to click on that. Ensure you are doing that for every suggestion that appears on your home feed. After clicking on the X, that account will not be suggested to you, and it will disappear.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://sentrypc.7eer.net/c/5597632/398457/3022" target="_top" id="398457"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/3022-398457"                      border="0" alt="www.sentrypc.com" width="980" height="120"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://sentrypc.7eer.net/i/5597632/398457/3022"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/delete-instagram-suggestion-post.jpg"                      alt="click on x symbol to delete suggested users"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> To delete multiple suggested users, just click on the see all option, and the list of suggested users will appear; now click on the X for each user you want to delete.

So, the only way out for you will be to open your Instagram mobile app and then do it from there by following the steps that we have mentioned for Instagram app users.</p><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-Avoid-Showing-up-in-Other-Users’-Suggestions-for-Your-List-3"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-Avoid-Showing-up-in-Other-Users’-Suggestions-for-Your-List-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to Avoid Showing up in Other Users’ Suggestions for Your List"></a>Part 4: How to Avoid Showing up in Other Users’ Suggestions for Your List</h2><p>Just like Instagram show you suggested users and posts, your account gets recommended to others as well. This is done so that your account can be followed by people who may be interested in your content. If you don’t want to get suggested by Instagram, then here’s what you need to do:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open a web browser and visit Instagram.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Now, look at the top right, where you can see your profile picture. Please click on that, and then click on the Settings option.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Scroll down towards the bottom, and you will find the similar account suggestions section. In this section, you will see a checkbox. You need to uncheck that if you don’t want your name to appear as a suggested user.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://ship7com.pxf.io/c/5597632/1509856/17634" target="_top" id="1509856"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17634-1509856"                      border="0" alt="" width="730" height="383"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/uncheck-similar-account-suggestions.jpg"                      alt=" uncheck the similar account suggestions box"                ></p><h2 id="Part-5-How-Does-Instagram-Suggestions-Work-3"><a href="#Part-5-How-Does-Instagram-Suggestions-Work-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: How Does Instagram Suggestions Work?"></a>Part 5: How Does Instagram Suggestions Work?</h2><p>Instagram takes note of everything that you do online. From analysing the posts, you follow, like, and comment on, Instagram tries to show you the best recommendations so that you can have a better user experience. The new feature that it has rolled out is the suggestions. The way suggestions work is quite simple.</p><p>The algorithm shows you suggestions based on your taste, the accounts you follow, and what you often browse through. This can be suggested users and suggested posts. Even if you keep your account private, you will still see the suggested posts, although suggested users will not appear. Instagram will keep track of what you like to see and explore, and based on that; the algorithm sends you suggestions that it thinks you will be interested in.</p><p>For example, let’s say you like to watch cats and dogs’ videos, so once you are done checking out the feed, towards the bottom, it will say “you’re all caught up,” and then it will start showing suggested posts of cats and dogs because you have checked similar content before.</p><p>So, based on that, it will start recommending posts and people that offer similar content. This encourages users to follow new people and stay updated with their latest posts. In addition to this, Instagram will also track the kind of hashtags you use, the posts that you have liked or commented on, and things like these.</p><p>So, even if you clear your search history, you will still end up seeing these posts. A user name will stop appearing if they go to their settings page and check out similar account suggestions. But most users don’t do that; hence, you will see their posts. Another thing to note is that these suggestions can be based on your Facebook friends as well because Facebook owns Instagram.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>So, now you know <strong>how to remove suggested posts on Instagram feed</strong> and how to go about it. Remember that Instagram suggested posts is a new feature, and there’s no way to delete this feature completely. You can certainly remove the suggested posts or suggested users, but you can’t completely remove suggested posts and users completely. However, this feature is quite handy because it lets you explore more content easily without going through the search tab.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a

So, while marketing a product on Instagram, you must know and understand the culture followed at Instagram.</p><p>For instance, when the brand <a class="link"   href="https://www.daytranslations.com/blog/how-pepsi-expands/" >Pepsi selected China to expand <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, the launch slogan was “Pepsi Brings You Back to Life” which was misinterpreted by the people as “Pepsi Brings Your Ancestors Back from the Grave”. This was a huge mistake for the brand when it was trying to make a mark on the global level.</p><p>So, prior to planning strategies for Instagram video marketing, you must be aware of the type of promotions and marketing you should plan so that you never go wrong with your strategies. You must know the audience and understand their choices, likes, and what can drive them to your video.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://ukaidot.sjv.io/c/5597632/1793233/19578" target="_top" id="1793233"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19578-1793233"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="1200"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1793233/19578"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Plan-Your-Instagram-Video-Marketing-2"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Plan-Your-Instagram-Video-Marketing-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Plan Your Instagram Video Marketing"></a>Part 2: How to Plan Your Instagram Video Marketing</h2><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://bluettieu.pxf.io/c/5597632/2042323/17091" target="_top" id="2042323"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17091-2042323"                      border="0" alt="BLUETTI NEW LAUNCH AC180T" width="3840" height="1600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2042323/17091"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Step-1-Know-Your-Objective-2"><a href="#Step-1-Know-Your-Objective-2" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Know Your Objective"></a>Step 1: Know Your Objective</h3><p>To ensure a successful Instagram video marketing strategy, it is important that your videos are not just moving pieces without any message to convey.

Thus, it is vital to have the correct size and dimensions. Creating highlight covers with proper width and height ensures that you do not have to crop any of your designs.</p><p>Generally, the Instagram highlight covers dimensions are the same as Insta stories, that is, 1080 pixels by 1920 pixels or a 9:16 aspect ratio. We recommend using square 1:1 dimensions when designing your custom highlight covers with high pixels as they work well.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2082532/7443" target="_top" id="2082532"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2082532"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2082532/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-instagram-highlight.jpg"                      alt="Filmora Instagram highlight "                ></p><p>When designing custom highlight covers on Canva, you will notice that the icon will be in the middle of a story-size rectangle.

Thus, it is vital to have the correct size and dimensions. Creating highlight covers with proper width and height ensures that you do not have to crop any of your designs.</p><p>Generally, the Instagram highlight covers dimensions are the same as Insta stories, that is, 1080 pixels by 1920 pixels or a 9:16 aspect ratio. We recommend using square 1:1 dimensions when designing your custom highlight covers with high pixels as they work well.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.massmailsoftware.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=1095219&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/dc87c13749315c7217cdc4ac692e704c/banera_for_partners-20_%281%29.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-instagram-highlight.jpg"                      alt="Filmora Instagram highlight "                ></p><p>When designing custom highlight covers on Canva, you will notice that the icon will be in the middle of a story-size rectangle.

These will be the posts from people who you are not following but might interest you. Although many people are happy with this new feature because it kind of markets you so that other people can start following; however, people who repeatedly see suggested posts aren’t really happy about it.</p><p>The reason? These people aren’t interested in seeing random people’s posts on their feed. If you feel the same and want to know <strong>how to turn off suggested posts on Instagram,</strong> you have come to the right place.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: What is Instagram Suggested?</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 2: How to Turn off Suggested Posts on Instagram?</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Part 3: How to Delete Suggested Users from Instagram?</a></li><li><a href="#part4">Part 4: How to Avoid Showing up in Other Users’ Suggestions for Your List?</a></li><li><a href="#part5">Part 5: How Does Instagram Suggestions Work?</a></li></ul><hr><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1997795">                    <video width="250" height="250" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1997795.jpeg"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/23621-1997795">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1997795.jpeg"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:250px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fproteahair.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1997795%2F23621'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1997795/23621"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->## Part 1: What is Instagram Suggested?<p>Instagram is working on its features and has recently rolled out the new feature called suggested posts. When Instagram suggests something on its own, it will be basically posts of random people who Instagram thinks you might be interested in checking out. These posts will appear when you reach the end of your feed.</p><p>Also, these posts will be based on what you prefer to see on Instagram, in general. If you are whether these will be the same as the ones that show up in explore, then no, they won’t be that. These posts will be related to the ones that you already follow or often browse through.</p><p>Suggested posts will let you scroll through Instagram a bit more and even give you a chance to follow the person you don’t follow. Along with suggested posts, there is another feature called suggested friends. You will see this right after you see the first or second posts.</p><p>The intent of these features is to know more like-minded people and follow them to see more of their posts.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Turn-off-Suggested-Posts-on-Instagram"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Turn-off-Suggested-Posts-on-Instagram" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Turn off Suggested Posts on Instagram?"></a>Part 2: How to Turn off Suggested Posts on Instagram?</h2><p>So, if you are searching for answers to <strong>remove suggested posts on Instagram,</strong> here comes upsetting news, and that’s there is no direct way to stop seeing unwanted suggested posts right at the bottom of the feed. Instagram has also made it clear that there is no way one can close suggested posts. However, this certainly doesn’t mean that you can hide suggested posts at all.</p><p>And to do that, all you will have to do is make your account private. Once you do that, you will only be seeing posts on your feed of the people that you follow.</p><p>Here’s what you need to do:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open your Instagram account and if you are not logged in, simply enter your credentials to log in. You can do this by visiting your Instagram mobile app or via the browser. Once your account is open, instead of going to your profile, stay on the home page, which shows you the latest posts of people you are following.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/instagram-suggestions-for-you.jpg"                      alt=" suggestions for you on Ins"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Go to the home page, where you can see posts of the people you follow. Now, scroll down towards the end and stop when you see the “you’re all caught up” message.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Right below that, you will see Suggested Posts, and the whole section will be filled with posts of people you don’t know.</p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Now, to stop seeing a recommended user’s post, you can click on the three dots. The dots will be towards the right of the user’s name.</p><p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Four options will be shown to you- report, not interested, copy URL, and finally, share. You need to click on the not interesting option.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4537547&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/4b0a0290ad7df100b77e86839989a75e/products/vcfpro.png"                      border="0"                >Video Converter Factory Pro</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/instagram-suggestion-posts-options.jpg"                      alt="click on not interested on suggested posts"                ></p><p><strong>Step 6:</strong> That post and user will be removed, and instead of that, you will see a message by Instagram asking for feedback. You can click on the option: I don’t want to see posts from this account, and Instagram won’t show you that user’s posts.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://sentrypc.7eer.net/c/5597632/398453/3022" target="_top" id="398453"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/3022-398453"                      border="0" alt="www.sentrypc.com" width="580" height="400"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://sentrypc.7eer.net/i/5597632/398453/3022"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/instagram-suggestion-posts-feedback.jpg"                      alt="choose your feedback option"                ></p><p>Now, you can apply the same steps for the rest of the posts as well.

From analysing the posts, you follow, like, and comment on, Instagram tries to show you the best recommendations so that you can have a better user experience. The new feature that it has rolled out is the suggestions. The way suggestions work is quite simple.</p><p>The algorithm shows you suggestions based on your taste, the accounts you follow, and what you often browse through. This can be suggested users and suggested posts. Even if you keep your account private, you will still see the suggested posts, although suggested users will not appear.

This encourages users to follow new people and stay updated with their latest posts. In addition to this, Instagram will also track the kind of hashtags you use, the posts that you have liked or commented on, and things like these.</p><p>So, even if you clear your search history, you will still end up seeing these posts. A user name will stop appearing if they go to their settings page and check out similar account suggestions. But most users don’t do that; hence, you will see their posts. Another thing to note is that these suggestions can be based on your Facebook friends as well because Facebook owns Instagram.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>So, now you know <strong>how to remove suggested posts on Instagram feed</strong> and how to go about it.

Although many people are happy with this new feature because it kind of markets you so that other people can start following; however, people who repeatedly see suggested posts aren’t really happy about it.</p><p>The reason?

When Instagram suggests something on its own, it will be basically posts of random people who Instagram thinks you might be interested in checking out. These posts will appear when you reach the end of your feed.</p><p>Also, these posts will be based on what you prefer to see on Instagram, in general. If you are whether these will be the same as the ones that show up in explore, then no, they won’t be that. These posts will be related to the ones that you already follow or often browse through.</p><p>Suggested posts will let you scroll through Instagram a bit more and even give you a chance to follow the person you don’t follow. Along with suggested posts, there is another feature called suggested friends. You will see this right after you see the first or second posts.</p><p>The intent of these features is to know more like-minded people and follow them to see more of their posts.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Turn-off-Suggested-Posts-on-Instagram-1"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Turn-off-Suggested-Posts-on-Instagram-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Turn off Suggested Posts on Instagram?"></a>Part 2: How to Turn off Suggested Posts on Instagram?</h2><p>So, if you are searching for answers to <strong>remove suggested posts on Instagram,</strong> here comes upsetting news, and that’s there is no direct way to stop seeing unwanted suggested posts right at the bottom of the feed. Instagram has also made it clear that there is no way one can close suggested posts. However, this certainly doesn’t mean that you can hide suggested posts at all.</p><p>And to do that, all you will have to do is make your account private. Once you do that, you will only be seeing posts on your feed of the people that you follow.</p><p>Here’s what you need to do:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open your Instagram account and if you are not logged in, simply enter your credentials to log in. You can do this by visiting your Instagram mobile app or via the browser. Once your account is open, instead of going to your profile, stay on the home page, which shows you the latest posts of people you are following.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/instagram-suggestions-for-you.jpg"                      alt=" suggestions for you on Ins"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Go to the home page, where you can see posts of the people you follow. Now, scroll down towards the end and stop when you see the “you’re all caught up” message.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Right below that, you will see Suggested Posts, and the whole section will be filled with posts of people you don’t know.</p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Now, to stop seeing a recommended user’s post, you can click on the three dots. The dots will be towards the right of the user’s name.</p><p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Four options will be shown to you- report, not interested, copy URL, and finally, share.

Instagram has also made it clear that there is no way one can close suggested posts. However, this certainly doesn’t mean that you can hide suggested posts at all.</p><p>And to do that, all you will have to do is make your account private. Once you do that, you will only be seeing posts on your feed of the people that you follow.</p><p>Here’s what you need to do:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open your Instagram account and if you are not logged in, simply enter your credentials to log in. You can do this by visiting your Instagram mobile app or via the browser. Once your account is open, instead of going to your profile, stay on the home page, which shows you the latest posts of people you are following.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/instagram-suggestions-for-you.jpg"                      alt=" suggestions for you on Ins"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Go to the home page, where you can see posts of the people you follow.

From analysing the posts, you follow, like, and comment on, Instagram tries to show you the best recommendations so that you can have a better user experience. The new feature that it has rolled out is the suggestions. The way suggestions work is quite simple.</p><p>The algorithm shows you suggestions based on your taste, the accounts you follow, and what you often browse through. This can be suggested users and suggested posts. Even if you keep your account private, you will still see the suggested posts, although suggested users will not appear. Instagram will keep track of what you like to see and explore, and based on that; the algorithm sends you suggestions that it thinks you will be interested in.</p><p>For example, let’s say you like to watch cats and dogs’ videos, so once you are done checking out the feed, towards the bottom, it will say “you’re all caught up,” and then it will start showing suggested posts of cats and dogs because you have checked similar content before.</p><p>So, based on that, it will start recommending posts and people that offer similar content. This encourages users to follow new people and stay updated with their latest posts. In addition to this, Instagram will also track the kind of hashtags you use, the posts that you have liked or commented on, and things like these.</p><p>So, even if you clear your search history, you will still end up seeing these posts. A user name will stop appearing if they go to their settings page and check out similar account suggestions. But most users don’t do that; hence, you will see their posts. Another thing to note is that these suggestions can be based on your Facebook friends as well because Facebook owns Instagram.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>So, now you know <strong>how to remove suggested posts on Instagram feed</strong> and how to go about it. Remember that Instagram suggested posts is a new feature, and there’s no way to delete this feature completely. You can certainly remove the suggested posts or suggested users, but you can’t completely remove suggested posts and users completely. However, this feature is quite handy because it lets you explore more content easily without going through the search tab.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shannon-cox.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Shanoon Cox</p><p>Shanoon Cox is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Shanoon Cox</p><h5 id="Shanoon-Cox-3"><a href="#Shanoon-Cox-3" class="headerlink" title="Shanoon Cox"></a>Shanoon Cox</h5><p> Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions</p><p>How to Turn off Suggested Posts on Instagram?</p><p>If you are an Instagram user, you might have seen something called a suggested post in your feed.

Take a look at the screenshot to understand better.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Now, on top of every suggestion for you, you will see the x mark. That’s what you need to click on that. Ensure you are doing that for every suggestion that appears on your home feed. After clicking on the X, that account will not be suggested to you, and it will disappear.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/delete-instagram-suggestion-post.jpg"                      alt="click on x symbol to delete suggested users"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> To delete multiple suggested users, just click on the see all option, and the list of suggested users will appear; now click on the X for each user you want to delete.

This is done so that your account can be followed by people who may be interested in your content. If you don’t want to get suggested by Instagram, then here’s what you need to do:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open a web browser and visit Instagram.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Now, look at the top right, where you can see your profile picture. Please click on that, and then click on the Settings option.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Scroll down towards the bottom, and you will find the similar account suggestions section. In this section, you will see a checkbox. You need to uncheck that if you don’t want your name to appear as a suggested user.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.massmailsoftware.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=1300375&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/dc87c13749315c7217cdc4ac692e704c/banera_for_partners-15_%281%29.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/uncheck-similar-account-suggestions.jpg"                      alt=" uncheck the similar account suggestions box"                ></p><h2 id="Part-5-How-Does-Instagram-Suggestions-Work-3"><a href="#Part-5-How-Does-Instagram-Suggestions-Work-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: How Does Instagram Suggestions Work?"></a>Part 5: How Does Instagram Suggestions Work?</h2><p>Instagram takes note of everything that you do online. From analysing the posts, you follow, like, and comment on, Instagram tries to show you the best recommendations so that you can have a better user experience. The new feature that it has rolled out is the suggestions. The way suggestions work is quite simple.</p><p>The algorithm shows you suggestions based on your taste, the accounts you follow, and what you often browse through. This can be suggested users and suggested posts. Even if you keep your account private, you will still see the suggested posts, although suggested users will not appear. Instagram will keep track of what you like to see and explore, and based on that; the algorithm sends you suggestions that it thinks you will be interested in.</p><p>For example, let’s say you like to watch cats and dogs’ videos, so once you are done checking out the feed, towards the bottom, it will say “you’re all caught up,” and then it will start showing suggested posts of cats and dogs because you have checked similar content before.</p><p>So, based on that, it will start recommending posts and people that offer similar content. This encourages users to follow new people and stay updated with their latest posts. In addition to this, Instagram will also track the kind of hashtags you use, the posts that you have liked or commented on, and things like these.</p><p>So, even if you clear your search history, you will still end up seeing these posts. A user name will stop appearing if they go to their settings page and check out similar account suggestions. But most users don’t do that; hence, you will see their posts. Another thing to note is that these suggestions can be based on your Facebook friends as well because Facebook owns Instagram.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>So, now you know <strong>how to remove suggested posts on Instagram feed</strong> and how to go about it. Remember that Instagram suggested posts is a new feature, and there’s no way to delete this feature completely. You can certainly remove the suggested posts or suggested users, but you can’t completely remove suggested posts and users completely. However, this feature is quite handy because it lets you explore more content easily without going through the search tab.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a
