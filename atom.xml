The app has made it huge in the social media game, with roughly 1 billion official app users and 500 million daily active users of IG stories. By just creating an Instagram account, people may share videos directly from their cell phones. However, because Instagram allows for varied video lengths, figuring out <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >how to post videos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> might be difficult. There is a specific time limit for each video genre. All of those video forms, including Instagram feed and story videos, IG Live and IGTV, Instagram reels, and ad videos, will be covered in this article.</p><p>We’ll start by discussing what we mean by “Instagram video.” Instagram video encompasses the Instagram feed, Instagram Stories, Instagram Live, and Instagram advertisements, among other things. Instagram continues to expand at a rapid pace as more consumers and organizations migrate to mobile. Businesses are flocking to Instagram since it has shown to be successful. That’s not all, though as millions of businesses join Instagram, the chances of you running into competition increase. Businesses need to have a presence on Facebook because their customers expect it and search for them there, and the same is true of Instagram.</p><h4 id="In-this-article"><a href="#In-this-article" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 <a href="#part1">How Long Can An Instagram Video Be?</a></p><p>02 <a href="#part2">How Do You Adjust The Duration Of Your Video For Instagram?</a></p><p>03 <a href="#part3">Tutorial for How to Record on GarageBand</a></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=194977&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.blumentals.net/scrfactory/images/screensaver-software.png"                      border="0"                >Screensaver Factory, Create stunning professional screensavers within minutes.

We’ve broken down Instagram video length details for each of them in this guide.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/instagram-video-length-1.png"                      alt="instagram video length"                ></p><h4 id="Instagram-Story-Video"><a href="#Instagram-Story-Video" class="headerlink" title="Instagram Story Video"></a>Instagram Story Video</h4><p>Instagram Stories are full-screen, vertical photographs and videos that vanish after 24 hours. Rather than appearing in the news feed, they appear at the top of the Instagram app. To make your material stand out, they use interactive features like stickers, polls, and Instagram Story filters.</p><p>Each Instagram Story has a length of 15-second time limit. If you upload a video that is longer than 15 seconds, they will automatically cut it into 15-second segments. However, based on testing, it appears that you’ll only receive four 15-second parts. Thus, this is only suitable for recordings under one minute.</p><p>Furthermore, to use the new feature and make lengthier Instagram Stories, simply tap the Your Story symbol and then press and hold the record button in the bottom-right corner for as long as you want to record a moment - without worrying about the 15-second limit.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/instagram-video-length-2.png"                      alt="instgarm story video length"                ></p><h4 id="Instagram-Reels"><a href="#Instagram-Reels" class="headerlink" title="Instagram Reels"></a>Instagram Reels</h4><p>Instagram’s newest feature is Reels. It also allows you to share small video snippets (up to 15 seconds in length) with all Instagram users. Before publishing your Reel, you can dub audio, tweak footage, and add instant effects. The Reel video will then appear in your followers’ feeds.</p><p>Instagram Reels length is now limited to 60 seconds in duration. Previously, the maximum length was 30 seconds, however owing to competition from TikTok, Instagram decided to raise it. TikTok, one of the platform’s main competitors, recently increased the video length limit to three minutes.</p><p>To use this feature, go to Create a New Reel and then press the left-hand down button to see the menu. To construct a reel, tap “length” to choose between settings.</p><h4 id="IGTV-Video-On-Instagram"><a href="#IGTV-Video-On-Instagram" class="headerlink" title="IGTV Video On Instagram"></a>IGTV Video On Instagram</h4><p>Creators can upload high-quality, long-form, vertical videos to Instagram TV, also known as IGTV. Users may use IGTV to generate more engaging content for their audiences. Because social media is all about sharing interesting content, IGTV is worth looking into.</p><p>Instagram’s IGTV section allows users to upload and view longer videos. IGTV videos length is of 15 minutes long on the Instagram mobile app and up to an hour-long on the Instagram website. And because these films are posts, they won’t vanish after a day as Stories do.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/instagram-video-length-3.png"                      alt="IGTV video length"                ></p><h4 id="IG-Feed-Video"><a href="#IG-Feed-Video" class="headerlink" title="IG Feed Video"></a>IG Feed Video</h4><p>The videos you submit to your main Instagram page, rather than your Stories, are referred to as Instagram feed videos. These appear on your followers’ Instagram feeds as well as on your main profile page.</p><p>Videos can only be 1 minute or 60 seconds long when posted to the Instagram feed. In addition, if you wish to submit a video to your Instagram feed or profile, you must keep it under 60 seconds. If you have a longer than a minute video, you must use the app to select a 60-second frame and post it to your feed. You can trim the video and choose your favorite parts utilizing the app’s built-in editor.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://parisrhonecom.sjv.io/c/5597632/1896607/21553" target="_top" id="1896607"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/21553-1896607"                      border="0" alt="" width="750" height="422"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1896607/21553"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/instagram-video-length-4.png"                      alt="IG Feed video length"                ></p><h4 id="IG-Feed-Video-Ads"><a href="#IG-Feed-Video-Ads" class="headerlink" title="IG Feed Video Ads"></a>IG Feed Video Ads</h4><p>The videos you submit to your main Instagram page, rather than your Stories, are referred to as Instagram feed videos. These appear on your followers’ Instagram feeds as well as on your main profile page.</p><p>If you want to share a video on your Instagram feed or profile, you must keep it under 60 seconds. If you have a longer than a minute video, you must use the app to select a 60-second frame and post it to your feed. You can trim the video and choose your favorite parts using the app’s built-in editor. You can then post it immediately to your profile. To do so, go to your profile and click the ‘+’ icon. Choose the video you wish to share and then click ‘next.’ That concludes the discussion. You can now share the movie on your social media accounts with an interesting caption.</p><h4 id="IG-Story-Video-Ads"><a href="#IG-Story-Video-Ads" class="headerlink" title="IG Story Video Ads"></a>IG Story Video Ads</h4><p>Instagram Stories advertisements are an excellent method to reach out to new people while also showcasing your brand, company, and products to an already engaged audience. Instagram Stories already have excellent engagement rates, with one out of every five stories receiving a direct reply from viewers.</p><p>The maximum length of an Instagram Story video ad is two minutes. You can utilize different story cards if you want to show your ad on an Instagram story. Each card can display a 15-second video or a single 5-second picture ad. Only the first three cards of a complete ad will appear in the Instagram story stream. After that, after touching on the ad, the viewer must choose whether or not to see more.</p><p>Furthermore, Instagram Stories will show 15-second or shorter video advertising for the duration of the video. Video ads lasting more than 10 seconds will be broken into different Stories cards.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1793213">                    <video width="1080" height="1620" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1793213.jpeg"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19135-1793213">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1793213.jpeg"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:1080px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Ftinyland.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1793213%2F19135'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1793213/19135"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->## How Do You Adjust The Duration Of Your Video For Instagram?<p>You must be thinking about how to upload flawlessly every time with all of these time limits and video publication options. Here are some helpful hints:</p><ul><li>If you’re worried your IG Feed video is too long and don’t want to edit it, make a video carousel post by breaking it up into smaller chunks. By swiping the post, the viewer will be able to see everything.</li><li>If you felt pressed to stay inside the time limit and made a video that was far too short, you can add more footage, slow it down, or add a loop. Another option is to use a video editor to make an intro and an end screen.</li><li>If your Instagram story is too long, you can cut it down using any Instagram video editor. Record the video, then open it in your app to edit and trim it down before selecting the clips to upload the full story.</li><li>In addition, if your Instagram ad video is longer than 15 seconds, Instagram provides 10 cards, each with a 15-second video duration limit. This will allow you to show your complete advertisement without compressing it.</li><li>The four-hour limit seems insufficient if you wish to have a more extended live stream on Instagram. Then, as soon as you reach the time restriction, you can easily go live again and re-start the stream as many times as you wish.</li><li>To make videos that will receive hundreds of likes on Instagram, you’ll need video editing software that allows you to change the aspect ratio of the videos you wish to submit. Wondershare Filmora is a video editing program that supports a wide range of video file formats and allows you to crop and prepare your videos for web use.</li></ul><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For Win 7 or later (64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For macOS 10.12 or later</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4620778&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/07dd4d5a72f5740ef0f035f201951476/728__90banner.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p><strong>●</strong> That’s all there is to know about the length of Instagram videos.

And because these films are posts, they won’t vanish after a day as Stories do.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/instagram-video-length-3.png"                      alt="IGTV video length"                ></p><h4 id="IG-Feed-Video-3"><a href="#IG-Feed-Video-3" class="headerlink" title="IG Feed Video"></a>IG Feed Video</h4><p>The videos you submit to your main Instagram page, rather than your Stories, are referred to as Instagram feed videos. These appear on your followers’ Instagram feeds as well as on your main profile page.</p><p>Videos can only be 1 minute or 60 seconds long when posted to the Instagram feed. In addition, if you wish to submit a video to your Instagram feed or profile, you must keep it under 60 seconds. If you have a longer than a minute video, you must use the app to select a 60-second frame and post it to your feed. You can trim the video and choose your favorite parts utilizing the app’s built-in editor.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4940312&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/333ac5d90817d69113471fbb6e531bee/sps-partnership-728x90eng.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/instagram-video-length-4.png"                      alt="IG Feed video length"                ></p><h4 id="IG-Feed-Video-Ads-3"><a href="#IG-Feed-Video-Ads-3" class="headerlink" title="IG Feed Video Ads"></a>IG Feed Video Ads</h4><p>The videos you submit to your main Instagram page, rather than your Stories, are referred to as Instagram feed videos.

You can now share the movie on your social media accounts with an interesting caption.</p><h4 id="IG-Story-Video-Ads-3"><a href="#IG-Story-Video-Ads-3" class="headerlink" title="IG Story Video Ads"></a>IG Story Video Ads</h4><p>Instagram Stories advertisements are an excellent method to reach out to new people while also showcasing your brand, company, and products to an already engaged audience. Instagram Stories already have excellent engagement rates, with one out of every five stories receiving a direct reply from viewers.</p><p>The maximum length of an Instagram Story video ad is two minutes. You can utilize different story cards if you want to show your ad on an Instagram story. Each card can display a 15-second video or a single 5-second picture ad. Only the first three cards of a complete ad will appear in the Instagram story stream. After that, after touching on the ad, the viewer must choose whether or not to see more.</p><p>Furthermore, Instagram Stories will show 15-second or shorter video advertising for the duration of the video. Video ads lasting more than 10 seconds will be broken into different Stories cards.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4718730&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/ce9a6fb2becc2d235e62b125e9260102/products/copy_vMixCallScreenshot1-large.jpg"                      border="0"                >vMix HD - Software based live production. vMix HD includes everything in vMix Basic HD plus 1000 inputs, Video List, 4 Overlay Channels, and 1 vMix Call<br>This bundle includes Studio 200 for vMix from Virtualsetworks, HTTP Matrix 1.0 automation scheduler, and 4 introductory training videos from the Udemy vMix Basic to Amazing course. </a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-Do-You-Adjust-The-Duration-Of-Your-Video-For-Instagram-2"><a href="#How-Do-You-Adjust-The-Duration-Of-Your-Video-For-Instagram-2" class="headerlink" title="How Do You Adjust The Duration Of Your Video For Instagram?"></a>How Do You Adjust The Duration Of Your Video For Instagram?</h2><p>You must be thinking about how to upload flawlessly every time with all of these time limits and video publication options. Here are some helpful hints:</p><ul><li>If you’re worried your IG Feed video is too long and don’t want to edit it, make a video carousel post by breaking it up into smaller chunks. By swiping the post, the viewer will be able to see everything.</li><li>If you felt pressed to stay inside the time limit and made a video that was far too short, you can add more footage, slow it down, or add a loop. Another option is to use a video editor to make an intro and an end screen.</li><li>If your Instagram story is too long, you can cut it down using any Instagram video editor. Record the video, then open it in your app to edit and trim it down before selecting the clips to upload the full story.</li><li>In addition, if your Instagram ad video is longer than 15 seconds, Instagram provides 10 cards, each with a 15-second video duration limit. This will allow you to show your complete advertisement without compressing it.</li><li>The four-hour limit seems insufficient if you wish to have a more extended live stream on Instagram. Then, as soon as you reach the time restriction, you can easily go live again and re-start the stream as many times as you wish.</li><li>To make videos that will receive hundreds of likes on Instagram, you’ll need video editing software that allows you to change the aspect ratio of the videos you wish to submit. Wondershare Filmora is a video editing program that supports a wide range of video file formats and allows you to crop and prepare your videos for web use.</li></ul><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For Win 7 or later (64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For macOS 10.12 or later</p><h2 id="Conclusion-3"><a href="#Conclusion-3" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p><strong>●</strong> That’s all there is to know about the length of Instagram videos.

Your account is at the top search results that build your account’s credibility. Whenever the question arises how to get verified on Instagram, several articles and write-ups inform that by building followers on the Instagram one can get easily verified.</p><p> This is a wrong notion and not completely correct.

Establish a Strong Social Media Presence</strong></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://aofit.pxf.io/c/5597632/1399701/16396" target="_top" id="1399701"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16396-1399701"                      border="0" alt="" width="960" height="300"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1399701/16396"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/get-1k-followers-every-month-on-instagram-01.jpg"                      alt="establish a strong social media presence"                ></p><p>To establish a solid social media presence, you need to make sure you’re posting regularly. That means posting interesting, engaging content that will get people talking.</p><p>But it’s not just about quantity – it’s also about quality. Make sure your posts are well-written and offer something unique or insightful that will add value to your followers’ lives. If you can do all of that, you’ll be on your way to social media success.</p><p><strong>#2. Optimize Your Profile</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/get-1k-followers-every-month-on-instagram-02.jpg"                      alt="optimize your profile"                ></p><p>Ensure your Instagram profile is complete, including a catchy bio and profile photo. Fill out all of the necessary information in the “Contact” section so that users can easily reach out to you.</p><p><strong>#3. Know your audience</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/get-1k-followers-every-month-on-instagram-03.jpg"                      alt="know your audience"                ></p><p>There’s no point in creating a great Instagram account if you don’t know who your target audience is, what they like and dislike, what they are interested in, and what they aren’t interested in. You need to know as much about them as possible before you start growing your following because this will help you create content that appeals to them.</p><p><strong>#4. Post at the right time of day</strong></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://twopages.pxf.io/c/5597632/1873313/18544" target="_top" id="1873313"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18544-1873313"                      border="0" alt="" width="1080" height="1263"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1873313/18544"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/get-1k-followers-every-month-on-instagram-04.jpg"                      alt="post at the right time of day"                ></p><p>As with most social media platforms, there are best times to post on Instagram. These vary depending on your audience, but the best time to post is between 9 am and 11 am EST (12 pm-2 pm GMT), 1 pm and 3 pm EST (4 pm-6 pm GMT) or between 6:30 pm and 8:30 pm EST (8:30 am – 10:30 am GMT).</p><p>There’s no exact science behind this; it’s just what has worked best in my experience as well as that of other Instagram marketing pros I’ve spoken with. The key is consistency—posting at different times makes you appear more human than if you were posting at exactly the same time every day—but not too much so that users get annoyed by how often they see new posts from you each day!</p><p><strong>#5. Use Hashtags to Reach a Wider Audience</strong></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mondly.com%3FAFFILIATE%3D108875%26RESOURCE%3D%2BEducational%2B300x600%2B"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/69c418c33ec2e1a4267fa9bb77fa1428/educational-300x600.gif"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/get-1k-followers-every-month-on-instagram-05.jpg"                      alt="use hashtags to reach a wider audience"                ></p><p>Using relevant hashtags is a great way to make your content more visible and accessible to people looking for what you have to offer. Hashtags can help you connect with like-minded people and grow your online community.</p><p>So, start using hashtags today and see the difference it makes to your content strategy!</p><p><strong>#6.

With so many people online at one time, it’s not always easy to get your posts in front of the right people for your business. However, once you know how to use hashtags on Instagram, you’ll be able to present your posts to the most engaged users, helping you grow your followers and your business as well.</p><p>Those who already know how to hashtag on Instagram have discovered the benefits this can bring.

Let’s get started.</p><h4 id="1-What-are-Instagram-hashtags-and-how-do-they-work"><a href="#1-What-are-Instagram-hashtags-and-how-do-they-work" class="headerlink" title="1.  What are Instagram hashtags and how do they work?"></a>1.  What are Instagram hashtags and how do they work?</h4><p>Before we can start on how to hashtag on Instagram, it’s important that we’re all on the same page in terms of what they are and how they work.</p><p>In a nutshell, an Instagram hashtag is a bookmark; a way of categorizing content. It can be any word, phrase, number or even emoji which is prefixed by the hash symbol (#). Clicking on a hashtag on Instagram will bring up all the posts that have used that hashtag, so that you can discover new content you are interested in.</p><h4 id="2-Why-should-you-use-hashtags"><a href="#2-Why-should-you-use-hashtags" class="headerlink" title="2.  Why should you use hashtags?"></a>2.  Why should you use hashtags?</h4><p>Whether you’re a startup, new to Instagram or simply haven’t managed to acquire many followers, using hashtags on Instagram is a great way to grow your audience. By finding out how to hashtag on Instagram, your posts can be found by a much larger circle of users.</p><p>As a business, using hashtags on Instagram will help you be discovered by people who don’t already follow your page, helping you acquire new followers and boosting brand recognition. Not only that, but when you know how to use hashtags on Instagram, you can increase your reach on other channels too, because when a user shares your content to Twitter or Facebook, the hashtag is shared with it.</p><h4 id="3-What-types-of-hashtags-are-there"><a href="#3-What-types-of-hashtags-are-there" class="headerlink" title="3.  What types of hashtags are there?"></a>3.  What types of hashtags are there?</h4><p>When deciding how to use hashtags on Instagram, it’s important to recognize the various types of hashtags so that you can pick the right ones for you. The right hashtags will depend on your goals as a business, as well as the type of content you are sharing at that time. For example:</p><ul><li><strong>Product, service and general hashtags:</strong> These might be what you do as a business (e.g. #painter) or what product you sell (e.g. #furniture). They are good for brands who want to make their work or products better known but can be difficult to achieve engagement for as there tends to be high competition.</li><li>**Niche hashtags:**For more chance of being seen, niche hashtags reduce the competition by being more specific about your product or service.

However, be aware these don’t tend to get more followers on their own, because people won’t be searching for or adding branded hashtags to their posts unless they are compelled to do so.

How to add a hashtag to your post"></a>4.  How to add a hashtag to your post</h4><p>If you’re not sure how to hashtag on Instagram, here’s a quick walkthrough. You can add tags as either captions to your post or in the comments area. As long as your account is public, the hashtag will ensure your post is discoverable via the corresponding hashtag page. Here’s how it works:</p><ul><li>Upload a photo or video to your Instagram account</li><li>Pick your filters and edit as required</li><li>Type the hash (#) symbol in the caption field followed by the text you want to be indexed for</li><li>Tap OK</li><li>Then share</li></ul><p>If you prefer to add your hashtag to the comments section, just find the post and type in your hashtag in the comments section. This is particularly good if you plan to use a lot of hashtags and don’t want to make your post look too messy.</p><p>Letters, numbers and emojis work as hashtags, but special characters and spaces do not. Don’t add in any symbols like * or %, and type words altogether without any spaces. You cannot add hashtags to other people’s posts, only your own, and can use up to 30 tags on any single post.</p><h4 id="5-How-to-find-the-best-hashtags-for-your-brand-2"><a href="#5-How-to-find-the-best-hashtags-for-your-brand-2" class="headerlink" title="5.

How to find the best hashtags for your brand</h4><p>If you’re not sure how to find the best hashtags for Instagram, there are a few options open to you:</p><ul><li><strong>Search:</strong> Just doing a simple search can throw up some interesting hashtags and useful data for your post. Click in the search bar and begin your query with a #. Instagram will present you with a list of suggestions as you start to type, as well as how many posts have been tagged with that particular hashtag. If you don’t know where to start, think about what your business does, provides or specializes in as a good launchpad. If you already have a list of keywords you use for SEO or PPC, this can be a great source of initial inspiration.</li><li><strong>Competition:</strong> If there are other businesses already on Instagram who are in your niche, maybe who have a sizeable following already, they may well already be leveraging a hashtag strategy which you can learn from. Visit their account and see which hashtags they use on a regular basis. If they’re posting the same tags over and over again, there’s a good chance they’ve already done a bit of trial and error research and have discovered the ones that work.</li><li><strong>Related:</strong> If you’ve got a hashtag or two already that you get good engagement from, visit the pages for those hashtags and see what else is posted alongside them. There may be other hashtag trends relating to your business that you haven’t thought of yet, and could try including in future posts.</li><li><strong>Influencers:</strong> Who are the biggest influencers in your industry? Is there a blogger who simply loves products like yours? If so, check out what hashtags they use, and follow along with their favorites to reach the people who follow them. Their audience is essentially the same as yours, so why not learn from the experts?</li></ul><p>Avoid using ‘spammy’ hashtags such as #like4like, #followme, #follow4follow and #followback. These are insanely popular among low quality Instagramers who simply want more followers, without caring about the quality.

Instagram is less strict than Twitter, in that you can use up to 30 hashtags per post. However, that doesn’t mean you should go all out on every post, so how many is enough?</p><p>For some insight into the ‘norm’, you can take a look at influencers and competitors and see how many hashtags they tend to use. You can also conduct a bit of trial and error testing to see how to use hashtags on Instagram to their full effect, by varying the number you use and tracking the results.</p><p>Research conducted last year found that there is certainly a case for the more the merrier. Buffer discovered that engagement was greatest on posts with 11 hashtags, at 79.5 per cent compared to just 29 per cent for one. A separate study by TrackMaven found that nine hashtags performed best.</p><p>As a general rule, there is no rule. Optimum hashtag numbers will depend on your industry, but there’s no need to be stingy as more definitely is more.

Let’s get started.</p><h4 id="1-What-are-Instagram-hashtags-and-how-do-they-work-3"><a href="#1-What-are-Instagram-hashtags-and-how-do-they-work-3" class="headerlink" title="1.  What are Instagram hashtags and how do they work?"></a>1.  What are Instagram hashtags and how do they work?</h4><p>Before we can start on how to hashtag on Instagram, it’s important that we’re all on the same page in terms of what they are and how they work.</p><p>In a nutshell, an Instagram hashtag is a bookmark; a way of categorizing content. It can be any word, phrase, number or even emoji which is prefixed by the hash symbol (#). Clicking on a hashtag on Instagram will bring up all the posts that have used that hashtag, so that you can discover new content you are interested in.</p><h4 id="2-Why-should-you-use-hashtags-3"><a href="#2-Why-should-you-use-hashtags-3" class="headerlink" title="2.  Why should you use hashtags?"></a>2.  Why should you use hashtags?</h4><p>Whether you’re a startup, new to Instagram or simply haven’t managed to acquire many followers, using hashtags on Instagram is a great way to grow your audience. By finding out how to hashtag on Instagram, your posts can be found by a much larger circle of users.</p><p>As a business, using hashtags on Instagram will help you be discovered by people who don’t already follow your page, helping you acquire new followers and boosting brand recognition. Not only that, but when you know how to use hashtags on Instagram, you can increase your reach on other channels too, because when a user shares your content to Twitter or Facebook, the hashtag is shared with it.</p><h4 id="3-What-types-of-hashtags-are-there-3"><a href="#3-What-types-of-hashtags-are-there-3" class="headerlink" title="3.  What types of hashtags are there?"></a>3.  What types of hashtags are there?</h4><p>When deciding how to use hashtags on Instagram, it’s important to recognize the various types of hashtags so that you can pick the right ones for you. The right hashtags will depend on your goals as a business, as well as the type of content you are sharing at that time. For example:</p><ul><li><strong>Product, service and general hashtags:</strong> These might be what you do as a business (e.g. #painter) or what product you sell (e.g. #furniture). They are good for brands who want to make their work or products better known but can be difficult to achieve engagement for as there tends to be high competition.</li><li>**Niche hashtags:**For more chance of being seen, niche hashtags reduce the competition by being more specific about your product or service. For example, #ladiesshoes rather than just #shoes will be found by more people specifically interested in shoes, while #ladiesheels will reach an even more interested audience.</li><li><strong>Interest hashtags:</strong> To reach enthusiasts in your niche, use interest related hashtags that describe your post. Research popular tags from the top posts section or see what specific groups are using to tag their posts. For instance, #shoeaholics or #heelsofInstagram will engage with those passionate about amazing footwear.</li><li><strong>Location hashtags:</strong> As you might have guessed, these tags are specifically the places where the content was show, for example #UK, #london or #hammersmith will find users who are interested in products, services or images from that location. You could also combine these with your service to narrow the audience even further, for instance #heelsinlondon or #londonfashionblogger.</li><li><strong>Branded hashtags:</strong> These types of hashtags are often used by businesses on Instagram to promote their brand or a particular ad campaign. You might promote the name of your business, e.g. #divashoes, or a slogan you are pushing, such as #comfortfit.

Be real and authentic"></a>5. Be real and authentic</h3><p>Instagram sponsorship programs require you to be authentic and realistic. Always make sure to stay true to your followers and post content that is representing your brand identity. While collaborating with brands and influencers on Instagram earns more revenues.</p><p>Never, ignore the fact that your followers are the reason behind your growth. Instead of littering your account with posts that are in stark contrast to your brand identity would cost you losing your followers, choose the ones that retain your visual identity. While you give a shout-out to other brands, don’t lose your brand’s voice at all.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ins-real-genuine.JPG"                      alt="ins real genuine"                ></p><h3 id="6-Don’t-forget-to-affiliate-3"><a href="#6-Don’t-forget-to-affiliate-3" class="headerlink" title="6. Don’t forget to affiliate"></a>6. Don’t forget to affiliate</h3><p>Instagram sponsorship for small accounts is obviously going to help you move ahead. Along with that make sure to affiliate with others for enhancing the sales of your brand’s products or services.</p><p>An affiliate is basically focused at improving the sales of brands partnering with them for a commission. Whereas influencers are basically involved with creating brand awareness. There is a trackable link or certain promo code that followers can click for actually buying your service&#x2F;product.</p><p>As links in Instagram are allowed only in the bio, you have to consider one product at once for applying affiliate links. Creating promo codes is a better substitute to entwine them with your posts. Though, Instagram is allowing links in Instagram Stories now.</p><p>Here are some popular affiliate platforms with online merchants that you can explore – ClickBank, RewardStyle, and Amazon’s Affiliate Program are a few of them. Use other marketing channels and your website to strengthen the affiliate program.</p><h2 id="Final-Comments-3"><a href="#Final-Comments-3" class="headerlink" title="Final Comments"></a>Final Comments</h2><p>We have now reached the end of the post and we’re positive that you have full insights on <strong>how to get Instagram sponsorship</strong> for making money.

Instagram actually allows up to 30 hashtags, but if you use between 4 and 10 hashtags, you’re going to get the most engagement possible. If you go past that, it won’t make a difference.</p><p>Also, always look at popular and banned hashtag lists. Popular hashtags will get more clicks; but if you used a banned hashtag, your post won’t show up in any hashtags. It’s all about balance.</p><p>Hashtags are a great way to get people to see your content and to be interested in what you’re doing on your website. If you learn the art of the hashtag and you start using it on your Instagram content, you will start to see a lot more engagement and sharing, which can help your audience to expand.</p><p>If you don’t know how to upload pictures and video Instagram posts, check this Ultimate Guide on <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Instagram Video Dimensions &amp; Story Size for a perfect post <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to drive millions of followers.</p><h2 id="Create-Gorgeous-Instagram-Videos-with-Full-Featured-Video-Editor"><a href="#Create-Gorgeous-Instagram-Videos-with-Full-Featured-Video-Editor" class="headerlink" title="Create Gorgeous Instagram Videos with Full-Featured Video Editor"></a>Create Gorgeous Instagram Videos with Full-Featured Video Editor</h2><p>Besides photos, video content is as popular as picture content on Instagram.

Instagram actually allows up to 30 hashtags, but if you use between 4 and 10 hashtags, you’re going to get the most engagement possible. If you go past that, it won’t make a difference.</p><p>Also, always look at popular and banned hashtag lists. Popular hashtags will get more clicks; but if you used a banned hashtag, your post won’t show up in any hashtags. It’s all about balance.</p><p>Hashtags are a great way to get people to see your content and to be interested in what you’re doing on your website. If you learn the art of the hashtag and you start using it on your Instagram content, you will start to see a lot more engagement and sharing, which can help your audience to expand.</p><p>If you don’t know how to upload pictures and video Instagram posts, check this Ultimate Guide on <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Instagram Video Dimensions &amp; Story Size for a perfect post <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to drive millions of followers.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=19080710&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://smart-seo-tool.com/images/SmartSEOAuditorBox.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Create-Gorgeous-Instagram-Videos-with-Full-Featured-Video-Editor-3"><a href="#Create-Gorgeous-Instagram-Videos-with-Full-Featured-Video-Editor-3" class="headerlink" title="Create Gorgeous Instagram Videos with Full-Featured Video Editor"></a>Create Gorgeous Instagram Videos with Full-Featured Video Editor</h2><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2087394/7443" target="_top" id="2087394"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2087394"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2087394/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Besides photos, video content is as popular as picture content on Instagram.

Around 95 million images are uploaded on Instagram regularly. Apart from sharing photos, it is also used to share videos. If you love using Instagram, you might have wondered how to see who viewed your Instagram posts. It is one of the most popularly asked questions on the internet. Before we proceed to See who viewed your Instagram post, keep in mind that you can only see the number of times your post was viewed but not who viewed your post. You can only see who viewed your photo or video if you have placed it in your story.</p><p>Unfortunately, you can’t see who viewed your Instagram post. If you have uploaded a video or image directly into your feed, then there are only two stats that you can view, the number of views you have received and who liked your post. Instagram doesn’t provide its user with access to this data. But the access to see who liked your posts is the same as who viewed them. Because all those who liked your post have also viewed it. But this only shows a limited number of people, and you will not be able to see who viewed and not liked your post.</p><p>There are two methods to see who viewed your post on Instagram. You might find these methods less accurate and less effective, but trust me these are the only methods that you can use to see who viewed your posts.</p><p><a href="#part1">01.

Yes, you can. You can see who viewed your video or photo only when you upload it through the story. Your story allows you to see who viewed your photo or video. After you have uploaded a photo or a video in your story, you can easily track the people who viewed it by following few simple steps.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> After you have successfully uploaded your video or photo on your Instagram story, wait for some time so that people can see your story. After 5 to 10 minutes, tap on Your Story located at the top left corner of Instagram.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/who-viewed-your-instagram-step1.jpg"                      alt="how to check who view your instagram"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> When you tap on ‘Your Story’, a new window will open up showing you your image or video that you have uploaded. Now at the bottom left corner, you will number of people who have viewed your story, tap on it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/who-viewed-your-instagram-step2.jpg"                      alt="methods to check who viewed your Instagram"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Now you can see the number of people who viewed your story and all those people who have viewed your Instagram story.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/who-viewed-your-instagram-step3.jpg"                      alt="check who viewed your instagram"                ></p><p>This is the easiest way of how to see who viewed your Instagram post. But if you are thinking about the images and videos that you post your feed or timeline, then you can see the number of people who viewed your post all those who liked it by following these few simple steps.</p><h2 id="How-to-see-who-viewed-your-Instagram-post-using-likes"><a href="#How-to-see-who-viewed-your-Instagram-post-using-likes" class="headerlink" title="How to see who viewed your Instagram post using likes"></a>How to see who viewed your Instagram post using likes</h2><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to any post that you want to track and see how many people have viewed and who liked it. Below your video or image, you can see ‘Liked by’. Click on the ‘others’ next to the name of the person who liked your post.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/viewed-your-instagram-using-likes-step1.png"                      alt="use likes to check who viewed your instagram"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Now at the top of the screen, you will see two numbers. The first number shows how many people have viewed your image or video and the second number shows the number of people who liked it. And the list below these numbers is the list of people who have liked your post.</p><p>Since this method doesn’t show you who viewed your Instagram post, it gives your few names in people who liked your post. These are the people who also viewed your post. I know this is not complete but Instagram doesn’t provide the data of people who viewed your post. So in that case, you can use this data to have an idea about who viewed your post.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://estore.winxdvd.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4612444&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.winxdvd.com/affiliate/new-banner/pt-728x90.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/viewed-your-instagram-using-likes-step2.png"                      alt="use Instagram Likes to check who viewed your Instagram"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=40085955&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/f702defbc67edb455949f46babab0c18/products/2_logo9.png"                      border="0"                >FX PRO (Gold Robot + Silver Robot(Basic Package))</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-to-see-who-viewed-your-Instagram-post-using-third-party-apps-Is-it-really-possible"><a href="#How-to-see-who-viewed-your-Instagram-post-using-third-party-apps-Is-it-really-possible" class="headerlink" title="How to see who viewed your Instagram post using third-party apps? Is it really possible?"></a>How to see who viewed your Instagram post using third-party apps? Is it really possible?</h2><p>After knowing that Instagram doesn’t provide the service to see who viewed your post, most users try to find alternative third-party apps that can help them achieve this task. You can easily find hundreds of apps that claim to show you who viewed your post as well as your profile. But don’t be fooled by these apps. When Instagram itself is not providing this data to its users and hiding this data, no one can do that for you. All the apps that claim to show you who viewed your profile and illegitimate and not trustworthy. By downloading and installing these apps into your phone, you are risking your privacy and security. Facebook acquired Instagram in 2016 ensures that there is no other way of how to see who viewed your Instagram posts because both Facebook and Instagram are using the same policies and site. Facebook doesn’t allow its user to access such data so does Instagram. There is no other way except the above two methods of how to see who viewed your Instagram post.</p><h2 id="Edit-Your-Instagram-Video-using-Wondershare-Filmora"><a href="#Edit-Your-Instagram-Video-using-Wondershare-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Edit Your Instagram Video using Wondershare Filmora"></a>Edit Your Instagram Video using <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h2><p>A well-made video is a secret to getting more followers on your Instagram.

Around 95 million images are uploaded on Instagram regularly. Apart from sharing photos, it is also used to share videos. If you love using Instagram, you might have wondered how to see who viewed your Instagram posts. It is one of the most popularly asked questions on the internet. Before we proceed to See who viewed your Instagram post, keep in mind that you can only see the number of times your post was viewed but not who viewed your post. You can only see who viewed your photo or video if you have placed it in your story.</p><p>Unfortunately, you can’t see who viewed your Instagram post. If you have uploaded a video or image directly into your feed, then there are only two stats that you can view, the number of views you have received and who liked your post. Instagram doesn’t provide its user with access to this data. But the access to see who liked your posts is the same as who viewed them. Because all those who liked your post have also viewed it. But this only shows a limited number of people, and you will not be able to see who viewed and not liked your post.</p><p>There are two methods to see who viewed your post on Instagram. You might find these methods less accurate and less effective, but trust me these are the only methods that you can use to see who viewed your posts.</p><p><a href="#part1">01.

Around 95 million images are uploaded on Instagram regularly. Apart from sharing photos, it is also used to share videos. If you love using Instagram, you might have wondered how to see who viewed your Instagram posts. It is one of the most popularly asked questions on the internet. Before we proceed to See who viewed your Instagram post, keep in mind that you can only see the number of times your post was viewed but not who viewed your post. You can only see who viewed your photo or video if you have placed it in your story.</p><p>Unfortunately, you can’t see who viewed your Instagram post. If you have uploaded a video or image directly into your feed, then there are only two stats that you can view, the number of views you have received and who liked your post. Instagram doesn’t provide its user with access to this data. But the access to see who liked your posts is the same as who viewed them. Because all those who liked your post have also viewed it. But this only shows a limited number of people, and you will not be able to see who viewed and not liked your post.</p><p>There are two methods to see who viewed your post on Instagram. You might find these methods less accurate and less effective, but trust me these are the only methods that you can use to see who viewed your posts.</p><p><a href="#part1">01.

Yes, you can. You can see who viewed your video or photo only when you upload it through the story. Your story allows you to see who viewed your photo or video. After you have uploaded a photo or a video in your story, you can easily track the people who viewed it by following few simple steps.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> After you have successfully uploaded your video or photo on your Instagram story, wait for some time so that people can see your story. After 5 to 10 minutes, tap on Your Story located at the top left corner of Instagram.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://sentrypc.7eer.net/c/5597632/398453/3022" target="_top" id="398453"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/3022-398453"                      border="0" alt="www.sentrypc.com" width="580" height="400"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://sentrypc.7eer.net/i/5597632/398453/3022"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/who-viewed-your-instagram-step1.jpg"                      alt="how to check who view your instagram"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> When you tap on ‘Your Story’, a new window will open up showing you your image or video that you have uploaded.

Is it really possible?</h2><p>After knowing that Instagram doesn’t provide the service to see who viewed your post, most users try to find alternative third-party apps that can help them achieve this task. You can easily find hundreds of apps that claim to show you who viewed your post as well as your profile. But don’t be fooled by these apps. When Instagram itself is not providing this data to its users and hiding this data, no one can do that for you. All the apps that claim to show you who viewed your profile and illegitimate and not trustworthy. By downloading and installing these apps into your phone, you are risking your privacy and security. Facebook acquired Instagram in 2016 ensures that there is no other way of how to see who viewed your Instagram posts because both Facebook and Instagram are using the same policies and site. Facebook doesn’t allow its user to access such data so does Instagram. There is no other way except the above two methods of how to see who viewed your Instagram post.</p><h2 id="Edit-Your-Instagram-Video-using-Wondershare-Filmora-3"><a href="#Edit-Your-Instagram-Video-using-Wondershare-Filmora-3" class="headerlink" title="Edit Your Instagram Video using Wondershare Filmora"></a>Edit Your Instagram Video using <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h2><p>A well-made video is a secret to getting more followers on your Instagram.

When you post a video on IGTV, chances are that it might get missed by your viewers. This is because the new Instagram algorithm only displays selective content in our feed.</p><p>On the other hand, all stories posted by the accounts that we follow will be displayed on the top banner of our Instagram home. Therefore, chances are that more people would see your story instead of a regular post. By sharing your IGTV video as your story, you can easily redirect your audience and let them know about the new content that you have posted.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.dbschema.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=19867419&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/176b22bab4e94a28619ca2433b2ef241/products/1_icon256.png"                      border="0"                ><br>DbSchema database designer for all databases, schema design in the team, schema deployment, interactive diagrams, documentation, data and query tools. </a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="A-Step-by-step-Guide-for-Sharing-an-IGTV-Video-on-Instagram-Story"><a href="#A-Step-by-step-Guide-for-Sharing-an-IGTV-Video-on-Instagram-Story" class="headerlink" title="A Step-by-step Guide for Sharing an IGTV Video on Instagram Story"></a>A Step-by-step Guide for Sharing an IGTV Video on Instagram Story</h2><p>One of the best things about Instagram is that you can share almost anything on your story.

Even today, recording a portrait video and showing it in any other context other than the Internet can be viewed as amateurish and embarrassing. However, the recently launched IGTV disregards all this, as it doesn’t allow its users to <strong>upload horizontal videos</strong> to its platform. What’s more, IGTV is rapidly growing in popularity, and the trend can be expected to continue in the foreseeable future. That’s why, in this article, we are going to show you <strong>three different ways of creating and sharing landscape videos on IGTV</strong>.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">IGTV Video Specs You Should Know Before Uploading a Video to Your Channel</a></li><li><a href="#part2">How to Upload a Landscape Video to IGTV from a Mac or a PC computer?</a></li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4726807&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/c14a8df1e1b4d5297e9cb30cb34d5a00/products/copy_copy_power-tools-48.png"                      border="0"                >Power Tools add-on for Google Sheets, Lifetime subscription</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="IGTV-Video-Specs-You-Should-Know-Before-Uploading-a-Video-to-Your-Channel"><a href="#IGTV-Video-Specs-You-Should-Know-Before-Uploading-a-Video-to-Your-Channel" class="headerlink" title="IGTV Video Specs You Should Know Before Uploading a Video to Your Channel"></a>IGTV Video Specs You Should Know Before Uploading a Video to Your Channel</h2><p>Instagram is famous for severely limiting the options its users have at their disposal because it only allowed them to post square-shaped photos for years. IGTV seems to be following the same pattern, not only because you can’t upload horizontally oriented videos, but also because your videos must be in <strong>MP4 format</strong>. Yes, that’s right, the platform currently doesn’t support any other video file format.</p><p>Even though you can now share videos that last up to ten minutes or an entire hour if you own a verified account, <strong>the platform also limits the maximum size of video files</strong> you can upload to your IGTV channel. <strong>A ten-minute video can’t be larger than 650MB</strong>, while the size of videos that last one hour can’t exceed <strong>3.6 GB</strong>. In addition, your IGTV videos can only have aspect ratios that range from <strong>4:5 up to 9:16</strong>. These specs make it easy to see why all the content you post on IGTV has to be created specifically for this platform.</p><p><strong>You may also like:</strong><br><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >What is IGTV and How to Use It: Everything You Need to Know&gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a><br><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >How to Download&#x2F;Save Instagram Photos&#x2F;Videos on iPhone&gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="How-to-Save-Instagram-photos-videos-on-iPhone"><a href="#How-to-Save-Instagram-photos-videos-on-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="How to Save Instagram photos&#x2F;videos on iPhone"></a>How to Save Instagram photos&#x2F;videos on iPhone</h2><h2 id="How-to-Upload-a-Landscape-Video-to-IGTV-from-a-Mac-or-a-PC-computer"><a href="#How-to-Upload-a-Landscape-Video-to-IGTV-from-a-Mac-or-a-PC-computer" class="headerlink" title="How to Upload a Landscape Video to IGTV from a Mac or a PC computer?"></a>How to Upload a Landscape Video to IGTV from a Mac or a PC computer?</h2><p>If you already have an Instagram account, you can upload your videos to IGTV directly from your computer.

Make sure to change <strong>the Frame Rate to 30FPS</strong> and click <strong>OK</strong> to confirm the changes you made.</p><p>Import the video you’d like to edit into Filmora by either dragging it from a folder on your computer and dropping it to the <strong>Media panel</strong>, or by clicking on the <strong>Import drop-down menu</strong> and selecting the <strong>Import Media Files</strong> option. Once you’ve imported the video file into the editor, you should place it on the timeline.</p><p>Head back to the <strong>File menu</strong>, and click on the <strong>Preferences</strong> option, or use the <strong>CTRL+Shit+,</strong> keyboard shortcut to bring up the <strong>Preferences window</strong>. Click on the <strong>Editing tab</strong> and select the <strong>Crop to Fit</strong> option from the <strong>Photo Placement drop-down menu</strong>.</p><p>You can then cut the video, change its duration or enhance its colors, before heading over to the <strong>Effects tab</strong>. The <strong>Filters menu</strong> contains the <strong>Background Blur folder</strong>, so you should just click on it and select the Background Blur you like the most. By doing so, you will cover the black areas of the video and make it more aesthetically pleasing.</p><p>Optionally, you can <strong>take a snapshot of your video</strong> by clicking on the <strong>Photo Camera icon</strong> located below the <strong>Preview Window</strong> in order to create a cover photo for your IGTV video. When done, you should click on the Export button, make sure to <strong>change the output format to MP4</strong>, and wait for the rendering process to be completed.</p><p>Once your video is exported from Filmora, you should go to Instagram.com, click on the IGTV icon on your profile page and upload the horizontal video to your IGTV channel.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=22741618&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.diskpart.com/resource/images/index/dp-index-img-banner-people@2x.png"                      border="0"                >Easy and Safe Partition Software &amp; Hard Disk Manager</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Using-the-Instagram-App-to-Upload-Horizontal-Videos-to-IGTV-from-Smartphones"><a href="#Using-the-Instagram-App-to-Upload-Horizontal-Videos-to-IGTV-from-Smartphones" class="headerlink" title="Using the Instagram App to Upload Horizontal Videos to IGTV from Smartphones"></a>Using the Instagram App to Upload Horizontal Videos to IGTV from Smartphones</h2><p>In case you’d just like to post a video to your IGTV channel, you can use the Instagram app to quickly create a horizontally oriented video. <strong>The stories editor</strong> enables you to accomplish this, but you should keep in mind that this solution only works if the duration of a video doesn’t exceed the <strong>15-second limit</strong>.</p><p>So once you launch the Instagram app, you should <strong>open the story editor</strong> and then tap on the <strong>Add button</strong>. This will enable you to select the video you’d like to edit.</p><p>After you’ve selected the video you’ll be able to see <strong>two arrows on the screen</strong>. <strong>Use your fingers to rotate the video</strong> and change its orientation from vertical to horizontal. Your video should occupy the <strong>middle of the screen</strong>, while the areas above and below the video should be blurred.</p><p>Tap on the <strong>Save icon</strong> to confirm the changes and proceed to upload the video to your IGTV channel.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://purchase.swifdoo.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=40002580&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/8b932759a5a04ddb34bf79e3f9072e4b/products/3_Product%20box%20white-1024x1024.png"                      border="0"                >SwifDoo PDF 2-Year Plan</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Creating-a-Horizontal-Video-from-a-Mobile-Device-with-GoPro-Splice"><a href="#Creating-a-Horizontal-Video-from-a-Mobile-Device-with-GoPro-Splice" class="headerlink" title="Creating a Horizontal Video from a Mobile Device with GoPro Splice"></a>Creating a Horizontal Video from a Mobile Device with GoPro Splice</h2><p>iPhone users can easily create landscape videos for their IGTV channels with GoPro’s <a class="link"   href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/splice-video-editor-maker/id409838725?mt=8" >Splice <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> app. You can <strong>download the app for free from the App Store</strong> and you won’t have to make any in-app purchases after you install Splice on your device.</p><p>Keep in mind that it is better to complete all other editing tasks before you start reformatting your video. Simply <strong>create a new project</strong>, select the video you’d like to share on your IGTV channel, and tap on <strong>the Add button</strong>. A new window will load, where you will be asked if you want to add music to your video, so if your video already has a soundtrack you can skip this step.</p><p>The app will then take you to the <strong>Project Settings</strong> window and you should just tap on the <strong>Format option</strong> and change it from <strong>Portrait to Landscape</strong>. Optionally, you can <strong>switch off the Outro option</strong> that is enabled by default or you can change the background color. Tap on the <strong>Done button</strong>, when ready, and proceed to export your video. Even though Splice offers the option to export videos directly to Instagram, you won’t be able to upload the video to your IGTV channel. So just save the video to your camera roll, and use the Instagram or IGTV app to upload the file to IGTV.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>None of the options for creating vertical videos for IGTV are perfect because each of them leaves portions of the frame empty. Basically, you will be creating a vertically oriented frame with a 9:16 aspect ratio, that contains a centrally positioned and horizontally oriented video. This is only a good option if the video you want to upload to IGTV doesn’t make any sense when it is vertically oriented, which can be the case more often than you’d expect.

Even today, recording a portrait video and showing it in any other context other than the Internet can be viewed as amateurish and embarrassing. However, the recently launched IGTV disregards all this, as it doesn’t allow its users to <strong>upload horizontal videos</strong> to its platform. What’s more, IGTV is rapidly growing in popularity, and the trend can be expected to continue in the foreseeable future. That’s why, in this article, we are going to show you <strong>three different ways of creating and sharing landscape videos on IGTV</strong>.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">IGTV Video Specs You Should Know Before Uploading a Video to Your Channel</a></li><li><a href="#part2">How to Upload a Landscape Video to IGTV from a Mac or a PC computer?</a></li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4726960&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/5f4f7141b65a730b4efb0e0d51f63e94/products/forexrobotronbox.gif"                      border="0"                >Forex Robotron Basic Package</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="IGTV-Video-Specs-You-Should-Know-Before-Uploading-a-Video-to-Your-Channel-3"><a href="#IGTV-Video-Specs-You-Should-Know-Before-Uploading-a-Video-to-Your-Channel-3" class="headerlink" title="IGTV Video Specs You Should Know Before Uploading a Video to Your Channel"></a>IGTV Video Specs You Should Know Before Uploading a Video to Your Channel</h2><p>Instagram is famous for severely limiting the options its users have at their disposal because it only allowed them to post square-shaped photos for years. IGTV seems to be following the same pattern, not only because you can’t upload horizontally oriented videos, but also because your videos must be in <strong>MP4 format</strong>. Yes, that’s right, the platform currently doesn’t support any other video file format.</p><p>Even though you can now share videos that last up to ten minutes or an entire hour if you own a verified account, <strong>the platform also limits the maximum size of video files</strong> you can upload to your IGTV channel. <strong>A ten-minute video can’t be larger than 650MB</strong>, while the size of videos that last one hour can’t exceed <strong>3.6 GB</strong>. In addition, your IGTV videos can only have aspect ratios that range from <strong>4:5 up to 9:16</strong>. These specs make it easy to see why all the content you post on IGTV has to be created specifically for this platform.</p><p><strong>You may also like:</strong><br><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >What is IGTV and How to Use It: Everything You Need to Know&gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a><br><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >How to Download&#x2F;Save Instagram Photos&#x2F;Videos on iPhone&gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="How-to-Save-Instagram-photos-videos-on-iPhone-3"><a href="#How-to-Save-Instagram-photos-videos-on-iPhone-3" class="headerlink" title="How to Save Instagram photos&#x2F;videos on iPhone"></a>How to Save Instagram photos&#x2F;videos on iPhone</h2><h2 id="How-to-Upload-a-Landscape-Video-to-IGTV-from-a-Mac-or-a-PC-computer-3"><a href="#How-to-Upload-a-Landscape-Video-to-IGTV-from-a-Mac-or-a-PC-computer-3" class="headerlink" title="How to Upload a Landscape Video to IGTV from a Mac or a PC computer?"></a>How to Upload a Landscape Video to IGTV from a Mac or a PC computer?</h2><p>If you already have an Instagram account, you can upload your videos to IGTV directly from your computer. All you have to do is head over to <strong>Instagram.com</strong> and then click on the <strong>IGTV icon</strong> on your profile page. This means that you can use Mac and PC-based video editing software products to edit your videos before you share them on IGTV.</p><h3 id="Using-Filmora-Video-Editor-to-Edit-IGTV-Videos-3"><a href="#Using-Filmora-Video-Editor-to-Edit-IGTV-Videos-3" class="headerlink" title="Using Filmora Video Editor to Edit IGTV Videos"></a>Using Filmora Video Editor to Edit IGTV Videos</h3><p>If you decide to edit the videos you want to upload to IGTV on a Mac or a PC computer, then we suggest using the Filmora video editor, because it offers all the tools you’re going to need to create a landscape video you can share on your IGTV channel.</p><p>Check out our video guide about how to edit videos for Instagram.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                ></a><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                ></a></p><p>Here is the process in word format in case you don’t have time to check the video.</p><p><strong>Create a new project</strong>, and then when the new project loads head over the <strong>File menu</strong> and choose the <strong>Project Settings</strong> option. Click on the <strong>Resolution drop-down menu</strong> and then select the <strong>720x1280 (9:16)</strong> option. Make sure to change <strong>the Frame Rate to 30FPS</strong> and click <strong>OK</strong> to confirm the changes you made.</p><p>Import the video you’d like to edit into Filmora by either dragging it from a folder on your computer and dropping it to the <strong>Media panel</strong>, or by clicking on the <strong>Import drop-down menu</strong> and selecting the <strong>Import Media Files</strong> option. Once you’ve imported the video file into the editor, you should place it on the timeline.</p><p>Head back to the <strong>File menu</strong>, and click on the <strong>Preferences</strong> option, or use the <strong>CTRL+Shit+,</strong> keyboard shortcut to bring up the <strong>Preferences window</strong>. Click on the <strong>Editing tab</strong> and select the <strong>Crop to Fit</strong> option from the <strong>Photo Placement drop-down menu</strong>.</p><p>You can then cut the video, change its duration or enhance its colors, before heading over to the <strong>Effects tab</strong>. The <strong>Filters menu</strong> contains the <strong>Background Blur folder</strong>, so you should just click on it and select the Background Blur you like the most. By doing so, you will cover the black areas of the video and make it more aesthetically pleasing.</p><p>Optionally, you can <strong>take a snapshot of your video</strong> by clicking on the <strong>Photo Camera icon</strong> located below the <strong>Preview Window</strong> in order to create a cover photo for your IGTV video. When done, you should click on the Export button, make sure to <strong>change the output format to MP4</strong>, and wait for the rendering process to be completed.</p><p>Once your video is exported from Filmora, you should go to Instagram.com, click on the IGTV icon on your profile page and upload the horizontal video to your IGTV channel.</p><h2 id="Using-the-Instagram-App-to-Upload-Horizontal-Videos-to-IGTV-from-Smartphones-3"><a href="#Using-the-Instagram-App-to-Upload-Horizontal-Videos-to-IGTV-from-Smartphones-3" class="headerlink" title="Using the Instagram App to Upload Horizontal Videos to IGTV from Smartphones"></a>Using the Instagram App to Upload Horizontal Videos to IGTV from Smartphones</h2><p>In case you’d just like to post a video to your IGTV channel, you can use the Instagram app to quickly create a horizontally oriented video. <strong>The stories editor</strong> enables you to accomplish this, but you should keep in mind that this solution only works if the duration of a video doesn’t exceed the <strong>15-second limit</strong>.</p><p>So once you launch the Instagram app, you should <strong>open the story editor</strong> and then tap on the <strong>Add button</strong>. This will enable you to select the video you’d like to edit.</p><p>After you’ve selected the video you’ll be able to see <strong>two arrows on the screen</strong>. <strong>Use your fingers to rotate the video</strong> and change its orientation from vertical to horizontal. Your video should occupy the <strong>middle of the screen</strong>, while the areas above and below the video should be blurred.</p><p>Tap on the <strong>Save icon</strong> to confirm the changes and proceed to upload the video to your IGTV channel.</p><h2 id="Creating-a-Horizontal-Video-from-a-Mobile-Device-with-GoPro-Splice-3"><a href="#Creating-a-Horizontal-Video-from-a-Mobile-Device-with-GoPro-Splice-3" class="headerlink" title="Creating a Horizontal Video from a Mobile Device with GoPro Splice"></a>Creating a Horizontal Video from a Mobile Device with GoPro Splice</h2><p>iPhone users can easily create landscape videos for their IGTV channels with GoPro’s <a class="link"   href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/splice-video-editor-maker/id409838725?mt=8" >Splice <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> app. You can <strong>download the app for free from the App Store</strong> and you won’t have to make any in-app purchases after you install Splice on your device.</p><p>Keep in mind that it is better to complete all other editing tasks before you start reformatting your video. Simply <strong>create a new project</strong>, select the video you’d like to share on your IGTV channel, and tap on <strong>the Add button</strong>. A new window will load, where you will be asked if you want to add music to your video, so if your video already has a soundtrack you can skip this step.</p><p>The app will then take you to the <strong>Project Settings</strong> window and you should just tap on the <strong>Format option</strong> and change it from <strong>Portrait to Landscape</strong>. Optionally, you can <strong>switch off the Outro option</strong> that is enabled by default or you can change the background color. Tap on the <strong>Done button</strong>, when ready, and proceed to export your video. Even though Splice offers the option to export videos directly to Instagram, you won’t be able to upload the video to your IGTV channel. So just save the video to your camera roll, and use the Instagram or IGTV app to upload the file to IGTV.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>None of the options for creating vertical videos for IGTV are perfect because each of them leaves portions of the frame empty. Basically, you will be creating a vertically oriented frame with a 9:16 aspect ratio, that contains a centrally positioned and horizontally oriented video. This is only a good option if the video you want to upload to IGTV doesn’t make any sense when it is vertically oriented, which can be the case more often than you’d expect.

It’s a platform where you can share your photos and let everyone know what you recently ate, went to, and so on. However, the same platform can turn out to be quite dangerous when someone targets you for trolling and harassment, and this is where the blocking feature comes in handy. So, if you want to learn <strong>how to block someone on Instagram,</strong> you have come to the right place.

Another thing is that the person that you will block won’t be notified about it. There are two ways to do that. One is through your Instagram app, and the second is through the web browser.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                > </a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                > </a></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.iobit.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4596923&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/184260348236f9554fe9375772ff966e/ascscan_468X60.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Method-1-Using-Your-Instagram-Mobile-App-to-Block-Followers"><a href="#Method-1-Using-Your-Instagram-Mobile-App-to-Block-Followers" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: Using Your Instagram Mobile App to Block Followers"></a>Method 1: Using Your Instagram Mobile App to Block Followers</h3><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Take your smartphone, Android or iPhone, whatever you are using, and find the Instagram app. Once you find it, open it and locate the person that you want to block.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Go to their account, now click on the three dots you see on the top right.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://proteahair.pxf.io/c/5597632/1983634/23621" target="_top" id="1983634"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/23621-1983634"                      border="0" alt="" width="320" height="100"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1983634/23621"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/visit-the-profile-and-click-on-the-three-dots.jpg"                      alt="Visit  Instagram Profile"                ></p><p><strong>Step</strong> <strong>3</strong> <strong>:</strong> Click on that, and you will see a small pop-up with multiple choices; you need to click on the block option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/click-on-instagram-block-option.jpg"                      alt="Instagram Block options"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Instagram will ask you if you want to block the person; click on the block option again.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/confirm-instagram-block.jpg"                      alt="Instagram Block  "                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.textstudio.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=35633309&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/d6eb8222c9718486bdabce8b897380f7/products/3_premium-icon.png"                      border="0"                > Take advantage of PREMIUM features for 12 months.<br>Create your texts &#x2F; logos without any limitation.<br>No attribution required when downloading.<br>No advertising on the website.<br> TextStudio.com  PREMIUM - Yearly Membership</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Method-2-Using-a-Web-Browser-to-Block-Followers"><a href="#Method-2-Using-a-Web-Browser-to-Block-Followers" class="headerlink" title="Method 2: Using a Web Browser to Block Followers"></a>Method 2: Using a Web Browser to Block Followers</h3><p>If you don’t want to use your mobile app, you can easily block a person using the web browser.

Yet again, you can unblock someone using your Instagram app on your mobile phone; else, you can use any web browser and do the needful. Readers must note that when you unblock someone, the unlocked user won’t know about it, but if they search you, they will be able to locate it. And if you don’t keep your account private, they will be able to see all the posts and stories you share.

You will see the privacy option; please tap on that.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Under the Privacy tab, you will see some sub-tabs, and one of them will be blocked accounts.

Let’s make it simpler. You have blocked someone recently, but you didn’t know that the same person has also done the same thing. Now that you have been blocked when you try to unblock their account, you won’t see it because that’s how blocked accounts work. You will not see the person’s account; their messages will be deleted, every like and comment shared on your profile will be removed too.</p><p>So, when the other person blocks a user, their account vanishes and doesn’t appear in the blocked list. Even if you try to find their profile by entering their handle on the search bar, you will see the notification “user not found.” And this is why you can’t unblock that person.

Let’s make it simpler. You have blocked someone recently, but you didn’t know that the same person has also done the same thing. Now that you have been blocked when you try to unblock their account, you won’t see it because that’s how blocked accounts work. You will not see the person’s account; their messages will be deleted, every like and comment shared on your profile will be removed too.</p><p>So, when the other person blocks a user, their account vanishes and doesn’t appear in the blocked list. Even if you try to find their profile by entering their handle on the search bar, you will see the notification “user not found.” And this is why you can’t unblock that person. Both of you have blocked each other.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2068425/7443" target="_top" id="2068425"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2068425"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2068425/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="FAQs-About-Instagram-Block-1"><a href="#FAQs-About-Instagram-Block-1" class="headerlink" title="FAQs About Instagram Block"></a>FAQs About Instagram Block</h2><ol><li><strong>How to see who blocked you on Instagram?</strong></li></ol><p>Instagram doesn’t offer you any direct way to know who has blocked you.

It’s a platform where you can share your photos and let everyone know what you recently ate, went to, and so on. However, the same platform can turn out to be quite dangerous when someone targets you for trolling and harassment, and this is where the blocking feature comes in handy.

Let’s make it simpler. You have blocked someone recently, but you didn’t know that the same person has also done the same thing. Now that you have been blocked when you try to unblock their account, you won’t see it because that’s how blocked accounts work. You will not see the person’s account; their messages will be deleted, every like and comment shared on your profile will be removed too.</p><p>So, when the other person blocks a user, their account vanishes and doesn’t appear in the blocked list. Even if you try to find their profile by entering their handle on the search bar, you will see the notification “user not found.” And this is why you can’t unblock that person. Both of you have blocked each other.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.pcdj.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4698827&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/47f4b6321e9fd8e8f7326a6adc1a7c1e/products/dex3REpage-newmainscreenshot.png"                      border="0"                >DEX 3 RE is Easy-To-Use DJ Mixing Software for MAC and Windows Designed for Today’s Versatile DJ. </p><p> Mix from your own library of music, iTunes or use the Pulselocker subsciprtion service for in-app access to over 44 million songs.

Also, if you can navigate to their account, however, can’t see anything, such as their profile picture, posts, and stories, that’s a clear indication that you have been blocked.

Use your credentials and log in.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> On the search bar, which will be there on the home page and not on the profile page, you need to find the person you want to unlock.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Visit their profile, and you will see the unblock option. Click on the unblock option to remove the profile from the blocked list.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/unblock-instagram-users-web.jpg"                      alt="Instagram Unblock from web  "                ></p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Click on the unblock option, and Instagram will ask you to confirm your choice.

Let’s make it simpler. You have blocked someone recently, but you didn’t know that the same person has also done the same thing. Now that you have been blocked when you try to unblock their account, you won’t see it because that’s how blocked accounts work. You will not see the person’s account; their messages will be deleted, every like and comment shared on your profile will be removed too.</p><p>So, when the other person blocks a user, their account vanishes and doesn’t appear in the blocked list. Even if you try to find their profile by entering their handle on the search bar, you will see the notification “user not found.” And this is why you can’t unblock that person. Both of you have blocked each other.</p><h2 id="FAQs-About-Instagram-Block-3"><a href="#FAQs-About-Instagram-Block-3" class="headerlink" title="FAQs About Instagram Block"></a>FAQs About Instagram Block</h2><ol><li><strong>How to see who blocked you on Instagram?</strong></li></ol><p>Instagram doesn’t offer you any direct way to know who has blocked you. However, if you have suddenly stopped seeing the posts and stories of a person you have been following, you can search for the person’s account. If no account pops up, it could mean that this person has blocked you. Also, if you can navigate to their account, however, can’t see anything, such as their profile picture, posts, and stories, that’s a clear indication that you have been blocked. So, there’s no direct way, and the only thing you can do is search for that person.</p><ol><li><strong>What happens when you block someone on Instagram?</strong></li></ol><p>Once you block a person on Instagram, they will no longer appear in your followers’ list. They will no longer be able to track your account, see your profile picture, posts, and stories. Also, the person won’t be notified that you have blocked them.</p><ol><li><strong>Does blocking people on Instagram delete your messages?</strong></li></ol><p>No, Instagram doesn’t delete the messages from your inbox, but what it does is make the chat thread inactive. This means the messages won’t show!</p><ol><li><strong>When you block someone, do their likes disappear?</strong></li></ol><p>Yes, both their likes and comments will disappear once you block someone.</p><ol><li><strong>What does it look like when someone blocks you on Instagram?</strong></li></ol><p>When someone blocks you, and you try to find that user, you will be shown this user is not available message instead of their profile. There won’t be any profile photo, and it would appear as if the person is no longer using Instagram.</p><ol><li><strong>When you unblock someone on Instagram, will they know?</strong></li></ol><p>No, Instagram allows you to block people remotely and won’t send any notifications. Even if you unlock them, they won’t know about it.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4530091&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img

By sharing your IGTV video as your story, you can easily redirect your audience and let them know about the new content that you have posted.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4712430&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/c404a5adbf90e09631678b13b05d9d7a/products/dlnow_256.png"                      border="0"                >DLNow Video Downloader</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="A-Step-by-step-Guide-for-Sharing-an-IGTV-Video-on-Instagram-Story-3"><a href="#A-Step-by-step-Guide-for-Sharing-an-IGTV-Video-on-Instagram-Story-3" class="headerlink" title="A Step-by-step Guide for Sharing an IGTV Video on Instagram Story"></a>A Step-by-step Guide for Sharing an IGTV Video on Instagram Story</h2><p>One of the best things about Instagram is that you can share almost anything on your story. If you want, you can easily share your own post or IGTV video. Besides that, if you wish to promote your friends, then you can share their IGTV video on your story as well. You can even customize it with the inbuilt markups available in the Story interface. To learn how to share IGTV video on the Instagram story, just follow these steps.</p><h4 id="1-Select-the-IGTV-Video-to-Share-3"><a href="#1-Select-the-IGTV-Video-to-Share-3" class="headerlink" title="1.

You can visit yours or anyone else’s profile and tap on the IGTV icon. By default, it is the second icon (between your photo grid and photos of you).</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://electronicx.pxf.io/c/5597632/1872456/14483" target="_top" id="1872456"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/14483-1872456"                      border="0" alt="" width="500" height="375"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1872456/14483"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/select-igtv-video.jpg"                      alt=" Select IGTV Video"                ></p><p>This will display various IGTV videos that are posted by that account.

Influencers are content creators on Instagram who also build communities across a particular niche or topic. Being a visually rich platform you always need the most visually dynamic content for better performance.</p><p>These content creators&#x2F;influencers usually focus on photography, travel, beauty, fashion, food, fitness, lifestyle, or celebrities sharing their personal lives on Instagram. Their fan following ranges from 1000 to millions. Content creators with 1000 to 100,000 and beyond followers are known as micro-influencers.</p><p>Influencers with attractive photos and videos gain more followers, but those with genuine photos and honest information are much loved and appreciated by their followers.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-become-an-Instagram-influencer"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-become-an-Instagram-influencer" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to become an Instagram influencer"></a>Part 2: How to become an Instagram influencer</h2><p>If you think about how to become a famous Instagram influencer, then here are some quick tips to guide you through.</p><h3 id="Step-1-Pick-up-a-niche"><a href="#Step-1-Pick-up-a-niche" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Pick up a niche"></a>Step 1: Pick up a niche</h3><p>First of all, you need to select a niche you are extremely passionate about. It should be something that suits your personality and makes you feel connected. You need to have some basic knowledge of that and curiosity to delve deeper.</p><p>On social media, you can’t fake it if it’s not your passion, somewhere or the other your true persona will take over. So, be very careful about that and don’t follow a niche that is trending, rather build what interests you. DIY crafts, kitchen hacks, travel, lifestyle, food, and so on are there to pick from.</p><p>Rather than posting random things, figure out what can go in combo and curate your content. For example, you love fashion and good at DIY. Then you can show how to make DIY clothing, accessories, recycle things, etc. and retain your posts’ originality.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://estore.zonealarm.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=38658749&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://sc1.checkpoint.com/sc1/za/images/boxes/pa_500.png"                      border="0"                >ZoneAlarm Pro Antivirus + Firewall NextGen</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ins-find-niche.JPG"                      alt="ins find niche"                ></p><h3 id="Step-2-Create-your-hashtags"><a href="#Step-2-Create-your-hashtags" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Create your hashtags"></a>Step 2: Create your <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >hashtags <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>Before you become an Instagram influencer, it is essential to understand the value of #hashtags.

While creating an Instagram campaign, it is essential to have a call to action within your video content which engages your audiences deeply with your brand.</p><p> Never make your content too sales-oriented, instead, consider driving your traffic to take a clear call for a certain reason by directing them to a specific page. The Instagram page and its specific segments are visited more than 11 times per day and it is definitely a sticky platform. So, you need to give your audience some very strong reason to leave the platform and move to your page as you want.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Best-Instagram-Campaign-3"><a href="#Part-2-Best-Instagram-Campaign-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Best Instagram Campaign"></a>Part 2: Best Instagram Campaign</h2><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://proteahair.pxf.io/c/5597632/1983634/23621" target="_top" id="1983634"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/23621-1983634"                      border="0" alt="" width="320" height="100"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1983634/23621"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="1-DJI-3"><a href="#1-DJI-3" class="headerlink" title="1.

The same goes for gorgeous city scenes captured on rainy nights or early in the morning on your way to work.</p><ul><li><strong>Inspirational Quotes</strong></li></ul><p> Life can be hard, and we all look for inspiration wherever we can find it. Posting inspirational quotes on your Instagram profile can be a great way to inspire others, especially if you post quotes that are directly related to the topic your profile is covering.</p><ul><li><strong>Combine several photos into a single Instagram post</strong></li></ul><p> A picture is worth a thousand words, but not all stories can be told with a single picture. Combining a few photos that tell the stories you want your followers to see, can be a very efficient way of promoting your products or letting your friends know about your latest adventure.</p><ul><li><strong>Selfies</strong></li></ul><p> Selfies have lost a lot of the popularity they had a couple of years ago, but this doesn’t mean that taking a creative selfie on an amazing location isn’t an awesome Instagram photo idea.</p><ul><li><strong>Important events from your life</strong></li></ul><p> Graduating from college, getting the first job, being promoted or moving to another country are all important steps in life, and sharing them with your friends on Instagram will surely help you get a lot of likes.</p><ul><li><strong>Animals doing adorable things</strong></li></ul><p> Pets are like children, we all get attached to them pretty quickly, so why not introduce your furry companions to the Instagram community. Besides, you’ll probably be able to get some amazing shots just by paying attention to the day your pet is having.</p><ul><li><strong>Animate your Instagram profile with Boomerang</strong></li></ul><p> The Instagram’s Boomerang feature is fun to use because it brings a motion to otherwise mostly static profile. The best part is that Boomerang can be used both for professional purposes and entertainment, with an equal amount of success.</p><ul><li><strong>Product Shots</strong></li></ul><p> Online entrepreneurs, as well as big companies, can use Instagram photos as a creative way of familiarizing their potential clients with products and services they are offering. Posting pictures on Instagram should be a part of every online marketing campaign because you never know who is going to stumble upon your photo.</p><ul><li><strong>Hilarious GIFs</strong></li></ul><p> People never forget how you made them feel, so making them laugh is always a good idea. GIFs are incredibly popular and very easy to make, so using your creative energy to cheer up your business associates and friends may help you increase traffic on your Instagram profile. However, you’ll need to have an app that enables you to post GIFs to Instagram, since the platform doesn’t support GIF files.</p><ul><li><strong>Delicious Food</strong></li></ul><p> We all love to eat, which is why pics of delicious food are never a bad idea. However, it goes without saying that taking a photo of every snack you lay your eyes on should probably be avoided . Post only food pics that offer something more than a view of a spaghetti bowl.</p><ul><li><strong>Yoga Poses</strong></li></ul><p> Taking care of your body means that you are taking care of your mind. Yoga is currently one of the most popular recreational activities in the world, and if you know a few good Yoga poses you shouldn’t hesitate to share them.</p><ul><li><strong>Photos of a venue</strong></li></ul><p> This Instagram photo idea works best for cafes, bars or restaurants, although all other types of venues can spark a lot of interest. What’s more, musicians who are playing at several different places in a single week can use these types of shots to promote their gigs.</p><ul><li><strong>Close-up shots</strong></li></ul><p> You can take close-ups of literally anything, however, it is important to take these types of shot in situations that are somehow related to the most important subjects your Instagram account covers. Close-ups are a great choice if you want to appear professional, and add an artistic touch to your Instagram photos.</p><ul><li><strong>Take shots that show your thankfulness</strong></li></ul><p> Show how much you appreciate the support your followers are giving you. You’ll make them feel involved and as a part of the success, your Instagram profile is enjoying.</p><ul><li><strong>A sneak peek of a new project you’re working on</strong></li></ul><p> Nothing sparks interest like a sneak peek shot of a project you are just starting. This Instagram photo idea is a perfect bait for comments and is best used if you want to promote your upcoming project.</p><ul><li><strong>Tell your Instagram followers all about your hobby</strong></li></ul><p> Make things personal, and let your friends know how you like to spend your free time. Hiking, making origami sculptures or reading make great topics for photos, and they give your followers an insight into your life.</p><ul><li><strong>Offer a good tip</strong></li></ul><p> Life hacks can be precious because they offer us a faster and simpler way of doing things. Even if you made a horrible mistake, offering a useful tip will prevent your followers from repeating the same mistake and offer them a way to improve their lives.</p><ul><li><strong>Explore new angles</strong></li></ul><p> Sometimes all we need is a fresh approach to things. The same can be said for Instagram photo ideas because just changing the angle from which you take photos can offer a new perspective on the topic you are covering.</p><ul><li><strong>Show the world what you really stand for</strong></li></ul><p> Sharing corporate values or standing up for the causes you really believe in can get you a lot of sympathy on Instagram. Take photos that reflect the values you stand for, and you’ll see how many people share the same values.</p><ul><li><strong>Share your achievements</strong></li></ul><p> Nothing motivates like success since we all love to watch success stories unfold in front of our eyes.

The same goes for gorgeous city scenes captured on rainy nights or early in the morning on your way to work.</p><ul><li><strong>Inspirational Quotes</strong></li></ul><p> Life can be hard, and we all look for inspiration wherever we can find it. Posting inspirational quotes on your Instagram profile can be a great way to inspire others, especially if you post quotes that are directly related to the topic your profile is covering.</p><ul><li><strong>Combine several photos into a single Instagram post</strong></li></ul><p> A picture is worth a thousand words, but not all stories can be told with a single picture. Combining a few photos that tell the stories you want your followers to see, can be a very efficient way of promoting your products or letting your friends know about your latest adventure.</p><ul><li><strong>Selfies</strong></li></ul><p> Selfies have lost a lot of the popularity they had a couple of years ago, but this doesn’t mean that taking a creative selfie on an amazing location isn’t an awesome Instagram photo idea.</p><ul><li><strong>Important events from your life</strong></li></ul><p> Graduating from college, getting the first job, being promoted or moving to another country are all important steps in life, and sharing them with your friends on Instagram will surely help you get a lot of likes.</p><ul><li><strong>Animals doing adorable things</strong></li></ul><p> Pets are like children, we all get attached to them pretty quickly, so why not introduce your furry companions to the Instagram community. Besides, you’ll probably be able to get some amazing shots just by paying attention to the day your pet is having.</p><ul><li><strong>Animate your Instagram profile with Boomerang</strong></li></ul><p> The Instagram’s Boomerang feature is fun to use because it brings a motion to otherwise mostly static profile. The best part is that Boomerang can be used both for professional purposes and entertainment, with an equal amount of success.</p><ul><li><strong>Product Shots</strong></li></ul><p> Online entrepreneurs, as well as big companies, can use Instagram photos as a creative way of familiarizing their potential clients with products and services they are offering. Posting pictures on Instagram should be a part of every online marketing campaign because you never know who is going to stumble upon your photo.</p><ul><li><strong>Hilarious GIFs</strong></li></ul><p> People never forget how you made them feel, so making them laugh is always a good idea. GIFs are incredibly popular and very easy to make, so using your creative energy to cheer up your business associates and friends may help you increase traffic on your Instagram profile. However, you’ll need to have an app that enables you to post GIFs to Instagram, since the platform doesn’t support GIF files.</p><ul><li><strong>Delicious Food</strong></li></ul><p> We all love to eat, which is why pics of delicious food are never a bad idea. However, it goes without saying that taking a photo of every snack you lay your eyes on should probably be avoided . Post only food pics that offer something more than a view of a spaghetti bowl.</p><ul><li><strong>Yoga Poses</strong></li></ul><p> Taking care of your body means that you are taking care of your mind. Yoga is currently one of the most popular recreational activities in the world, and if you know a few good Yoga poses you shouldn’t hesitate to share them.</p><ul><li><strong>Photos of a venue</strong></li></ul><p> This Instagram photo idea works best for cafes, bars or restaurants, although all other types of venues can spark a lot of interest. What’s more, musicians who are playing at several different places in a single week can use these types of shots to promote their gigs.</p><ul><li><strong>Close-up shots</strong></li></ul><p> You can take close-ups of literally anything, however, it is important to take these types of shot in situations that are somehow related to the most important subjects your Instagram account covers. Close-ups are a great choice if you want to appear professional, and add an artistic touch to your Instagram photos.</p><ul><li><strong>Take shots that show your thankfulness</strong></li></ul><p> Show how much you appreciate the support your followers are giving you. You’ll make them feel involved and as a part of the success, your Instagram profile is enjoying.</p><ul><li><strong>A sneak peek of a new project you’re working on</strong></li></ul><p> Nothing sparks interest like a sneak peek shot of a project you are just starting. This Instagram photo idea is a perfect bait for comments and is best used if you want to promote your upcoming project.</p><ul><li><strong>Tell your Instagram followers all about your hobby</strong></li></ul><p> Make things personal, and let your friends know how you like to spend your free time. Hiking, making origami sculptures or reading make great topics for photos, and they give your followers an insight into your life.</p><ul><li><strong>Offer a good tip</strong></li></ul><p> Life hacks can be precious because they offer us a faster and simpler way of doing things. Even if you made a horrible mistake, offering a useful tip will prevent your followers from repeating the same mistake and offer them a way to improve their lives.</p><ul><li><strong>Explore new angles</strong></li></ul><p> Sometimes all we need is a fresh approach to things. The same can be said for Instagram photo ideas because just changing the angle from which you take photos can offer a new perspective on the topic you are covering.</p><ul><li><strong>Show the world what you really stand for</strong></li></ul><p> Sharing corporate values or standing up for the causes you really believe in can get you a lot of sympathy on Instagram. Take photos that reflect the values you stand for, and you’ll see how many people share the same values.</p><ul><li><strong>Share your achievements</strong></li></ul><p> Nothing motivates like success since we all love to watch success stories unfold in front of our eyes. Each of your achievements can inspire others to do great things, so don’t hesitate to use them as an idea for your Instagram photos.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a

Make it easy for users to find you"></a>1. Make it easy for users to find you</h3><p>You could have the best images, the most insightful content, and work as hard as you like on your account, but if users can’t find you, it will all be for nothing. If your fans don’t know you’re there, they are never going to follow you.</p><p>To increase your visibility, use the tools you already have in place. If you have a fan base on Facebook, Twitter, or any other social network, cross-promote your Instagram page with those people, encouraging them to follow you. Consider paying to boost these posts to ensure even more of your existing fans are driven towards your Instagram account.</p><p>You can also place a link on your website to help visitors find you on Instagram and could consider including a link in your email signatures and other public-facing profiles. When you’re keen to discover how to increase followers on Instagram, maximizing the use of existing resources is a no-brainer.</p><h3 id="2-Optimize-your-profile"><a href="#2-Optimize-your-profile" class="headerlink" title="2. Optimize your profile"></a>2. Optimize your profile</h3><p>You want your profile to be a powerful piece of marketing, so don’t scrimp on your time investment here either. Make it look professional, describe who you are and what you do, giving them a good reason to hit the ‘follow’ button.</p><p>For a start, you need to ensure your username is easy to find. Using your business name is ideal, but if it’s already taken, you’ll need to get creative. Keep your business name in the first part of the tag, so those searching for you will still be able to find you. For example, if your business is called James Retail but @jamesretail is already in use, you could use @jamesretailUSA or @jamesretailofficial.</p><p>Choose a profile picture that’s brand focussed; your logo is a great choice. Fill your bio with engaging information about your brand, but sprinkle in a bit of personality too. Add a link to your website but consider a shortened customizable link from a provider such as Bitly to make your profile as tidy as possible.</p><p>Tweaking your profile can make all the difference when it comes to how to get IG followers, so it’s a good idea to review what yours says on a relatively regular basis to ensure it’s up to date. Take a look at the profiles of some of your competition to see what’s working for them, then you can make improvements to your own.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2082538/7443" target="_top" id="2082538"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2082538"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2082538/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="3-Tell-a-consistent-story"><a href="#3-Tell-a-consistent-story" class="headerlink" title="3. Tell a consistent story"></a>3. Tell a consistent story</h3><p>Consistency and regularity are the keys to how to get more followers on IG. Think about your brand story and purposeful content that will get your audience truly engaged. Instagram is a highly visual channel that needs perfect curation to get the very best results.</p><p>Maybe you’re all about your products; showing off how they look, demonstrating the problems they solve, or enlightening customers as to how they get made. Or perhaps you’re a service-based business, more interested in inspiring your customers with aspirational posts and motivational ideas. Whatever your brand represents, ensuring a reliable image is presented throughout all your posts will help you attract new followers, and keep them.</p><p>This doesn’t mean you have to limit your Instagram content in any way, but your posts should have a clear message and consistent ideas. Your visuals should be instantly recognizable at a glance and should present a cohesive narrative across this social channel.</p><h3 id="4-Use-hashtags"><a href="#4-Use-hashtags" class="headerlink" title="4. Use hashtags"></a>4. Use hashtags</h3><p>Hashtags are one of the best ways of how to increase followers on IG. Good use of powerful, relevant hashtags will expose your posts to people who are not followers of your page, but who are interested in the kind of content you are producing. When you start using hashtags, achieve success quickly by:</p><ul><li><strong>Checking out the most popular:</strong> Have a look at popular hashtags for your industry. What are your competitors using? What about influencers in your niche?</li><li><strong>Using niche tags:</strong> Getting niche with your tags will grab the attention of a narrower audience, but one which is much more engaged with your business.</li><li><strong>Create your own tag:</strong> Use your own branded hashtag with your posts and promote it with contests and on other channels to get people starting to use it.</li><li><strong>Use enough hashtags:</strong> You can place up to 30 hashtags on any one post but using all 30 every time is probably a little too much. Research shows that between 9 – 11 hashtags tend to be the optimal number, but this will vary by industry.</li><li><strong>Avoid spammy hashtags:</strong> Don’t be tempted into using #like4like or #followback type tags, as although you may find you get more followers, they will be low quality and not really interested in your content.</li></ul><p>Find out more about using hashtags in our guide on <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >how to use hashtags on Instagram. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2075471/7443" target="_top" id="2075471"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2075471"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2075471/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="5-Pick-the-right-time-to-post"><a href="#5-Pick-the-right-time-to-post" class="headerlink" title="5. Pick the right time to post"></a>5. Pick the right time to post</h3><p>Posting consistently is one hurdle to overcome; refining the times at which you post is another. An analysis by Tailwind looking at how to gain followers on Instagram, they found that brands who posted at least once a day grew their fans four times faster than those who only posted once a week.</p><p>Posting when your users are most active on Instagram is key to success. When your followers see your post, they’ll be compelled to interact with it with a like or a comment. This will then expose your content to more people, generating more interaction, and even more exposure. Finding out what time to post on Instagram is not always easy, but as you learn about your customers and what their schedule is like, you’ll become more aware of good times to post.</p><p>For instance, if your audience is mainly working people, they are likely to be busy checking emails and planning their days between 9 – 11 am, so that’s not a good time to post. Stay at home mums, however, may well be browsing Instagram around 9 – 10 am after the school run. B2B companies will surely find a sweet spot around 12 – 2 pm when people are on their lunch break.</p><p>Find your optimal posting time by testing posts at different times of the day. Use a scheduling tool to plan and organize your posts, but also make sure someone is available to respond to comments when the post goes live.</p><p>Check our <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >When is The Best Time to Post on Instagram <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> Guide to know more.</p><h3 id="6-Tag-other-users"><a href="#6-Tag-other-users" class="headerlink" title="6. Tag other users"></a>6. Tag other users</h3><p>Adding a specific user’s tag to your posts will encourage them to share it too, helping to expose your business to more new people. When working on how to get more IG followers, engaging with specific influencers is crucial. However, don’t just go randomly tagging them, as this is unlikely to get the desired response. Engage with them through their own posts, and then use this relationship to help grow your own following.</p><p>You can also get users to tag other users in your posts. Captions such as ‘tag someone who feels like this on a Monday’ or ‘tag the person you’d love to be on this beach with’ will get people tagging their friends like mad. Suddenly you’re exposed to many other Instagram users and have started to build your following even more.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://aspironcom.sjv.io/c/5597632/1941789/21554" target="_top" id="1941789"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/21554-1941789"                      border="0" alt="" width="650" height="800"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1941789/21554"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="7-Run-a-competition"><a href="#7-Run-a-competition" class="headerlink" title="7. Run a competition"></a>7. Run a competition</h3><p>Contests and competitions are one of the best ways to find out how to get IG followers. There are many ways you can run your contest, from getting people to use a specific hashtag to asking them to comment, like, or follow your account. You don’t need to be a multibillion-dollar business to run a competition successfully, but it does need to be of high enough value to encourage interaction.</p><p>Some ideas for a competition could be:</p><ul><li>Win a fashion voucher by sharing images of the perfect work outfit</li><li>Win a camera for sharing pictures of inspirational locations</li><li>A draw to win an iPad which is entered by liking &#x2F; following your account</li><li>A merchandise goody bag for tagging a friend you’d bring to your restaurant</li></ul><p>Competitions can be great fun, so get creative and think of some exciting offers and engagement opportunities for your specific brand.</p><h3 id="8-Get-to-grips-with-live-video"><a href="#8-Get-to-grips-with-live-video" class="headerlink" title="8. Get to grips with live video"></a>8. Get to grips with live video</h3><p>Livestreaming is huge right now, on all social platforms, and Instagram is no different. It’s the ideal way to share coverage of a conference, a trade show, a training opportunity or to run a Q&amp;A session. You could showcase your factory, do a tour of your offices, cover the opening of your new store… anything really.</p><p>Live streams on Instagram appear at the top of your follower’s feeds, making it an ideal way to engage deeply with those who already follow you. Encourage viewers to tag their friends, perhaps by running a giveaway as part of the video. Users who are online when you start broadcasting will be instantly notified of your live stream, making it a great way to really grab people’s attention.</p><p>You can choose to have your stream disappear as soon as it’s been completed or to have it available in your brand’s story area for 24 hours. Your story also appears at the top of your follower’s feeds, offering you a great opportunity to engage with those who missed the live stream itself.</p><p><strong>You May Also Like:</strong> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >How to Go Live On Instagram &gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h3 id="9-Use-Instagram-ads"><a href="#9-Use-Instagram-ads" class="headerlink" title="9. Use Instagram ads"></a>9. Use Instagram ads</h3><p>If you’re serious about how to get more followers on IG, making use of Instagram ads is going to be important for you. These allow you to reach out to new followers rapidly, presenting your carefully crafted content to people who may never have heard of you before.</p><p>Using the advertising tools built into Instagram, you can make your ads highly targeted too. Pick who you want to see your ads based on interests and behaviors, demographics, geographic locations, and a swathe of other parameters to help you reach the right people. You are able to advertise in both Instagram feeds and in stories, so explore all your options and test different strategies to see what works best for your business.</p><h3 id="10-Use-Instagram-insights"><a href="#10-Use-Instagram-insights" class="headerlink" title="10. Use Instagram insights"></a>10. Use Instagram insights</h3><p>Instagram was the last social network to really get on board with providing data, but thank goodness they do now, and we should all be using it to discover how to gain followers on Instagram. The analytics and insights provided by Instagram are absolute marketing gold dust, so take the time to get to grips with what you can discover to continue to grow your following.</p><p><strong>You May Also Like</strong> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Instagram Analytics Tools for Better Tracking Your Metrics &gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>You can view insights for your whole account using the chart button on the top right of your profile page, or for an individual post by navigating to that post and clicking ‘view insights’ in the bottom left. When you visit Insights for your account, you’ll see:</p><ul><li><strong>Impressions:</strong> How many times your ad or content appeared on feeds</li><li><strong>Reach:</strong> How many unique users have seen your posts</li><li><strong>Clicks:</strong> A count of the times people have clicked any link you’ve added to your business profile</li><li><strong>Visits:</strong> How many times your profile page has been looked at</li><li><strong>Followers:</strong> How many followers you’ve acquired or lost in the last week</li></ul><p>The ‘followers’ section will also tell you what times of day your followers are most active, which is highly informative when it comes to planning your posting times. If you choose to view insights for a particular post, you’ll be able to see:</p><ul><li><strong>Likes:</strong> How many like your post generated</li><li><strong>Comments:</strong> How many comments were left</li><li><strong>Saves:</strong> How many users saved or bookmarked your post</li><li><strong>Actions:</strong> How many actions were taken, such as visiting your profile, following you or clicking a link to your website</li><li><strong>Discovery:</strong> This metric shows where your post was seen the most, including how many accounts were not following you when they first saw you post</li></ul><p>As you can imagine, when you start drilling down into these metrics and keeping a record of data over a period of time, it’s easy to see patterns beginning to emerge. These patterns will be crucial to tailoring your strategy as you move forward, and to ensure you know how to gain followers on Instagram ongoing.</p><p>So now you know some of the right ways of how to <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >get more followers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> on IG. However, there is one way of how to get IG followers which we have not mentioned, and that’s by buying them. We absolutely cannot recommend this tactic for how to gain followers on Instagram, as it’s not good practice and won’t help you in the long run.</p><p>Fake followers are unlikely to engage with your posts, unlike real followers, so you lose all the benefits that come with healthy-looking numbers. If you have 100k followers and yet only get 200 likes when you post, it’s going to become pretty obvious that your followers are not real. Not only that, but buying followers is against Instagram’s Terms of Use, and if you get found out, you could have your account suspended.</p><p>Growing your following organically is a much better strategy, and while it does take time and commitment, it’s not the hardest thing to do. Knuckle down, do things right and you’ll be growing your Instagram fanbase in no time.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shannon-cox.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Shanoon Cox</p><p>Shanoon Cox is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Shanoon Cox</p><h5 id="Shanoon-Cox-1"><a href="#Shanoon-Cox-1" class="headerlink" title="Shanoon Cox"></a>Shanoon Cox</h5><p> Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions</p><p>With 800 million active users on the platform, you’d think the answer to how to get more followers on Instagram would be easy.

Make it look professional, describe who you are and what you do, giving them a good reason to hit the ‘follow’ button.</p><p>For a start, you need to ensure your username is easy to find. Using your business name is ideal, but if it’s already taken, you’ll need to get creative. Keep your business name in the first part of the tag, so those searching for you will still be able to find you. For example, if your business is called James Retail but @jamesretail is already in use, you could use @jamesretailUSA or @jamesretailofficial.</p><p>Choose a profile picture that’s brand focussed; your logo is a great choice. Fill your bio with engaging information about your brand, but sprinkle in a bit of personality too. Add a link to your website but consider a shortened customizable link from a provider such as Bitly to make your profile as tidy as possible.</p><p>Tweaking your profile can make all the difference when it comes to how to get IG followers, so it’s a good idea to review what yours says on a relatively regular basis to ensure it’s up to date.

Think about your brand story and purposeful content that will get your audience truly engaged. Instagram is a highly visual channel that needs perfect curation to get the very best results.</p><p>Maybe you’re all about your products; showing off how they look, demonstrating the problems they solve, or enlightening customers as to how they get made. Or perhaps you’re a service-based business, more interested in inspiring your customers with aspirational posts and motivational ideas. Whatever your brand represents, ensuring a reliable image is presented throughout all your posts will help you attract new followers, and keep them.</p><p>This doesn’t mean you have to limit your Instagram content in any way, but your posts should have a clear message and consistent ideas.

Use hashtags"></a>4. Use hashtags</h3><p>Hashtags are one of the best ways of how to increase followers on IG. Good use of powerful, relevant hashtags will expose your posts to people who are not followers of your page, but who are interested in the kind of content you are producing. When you start using hashtags, achieve success quickly by:</p><ul><li><strong>Checking out the most popular:</strong> Have a look at popular hashtags for your industry. What are your competitors using? What about influencers in your niche?</li><li><strong>Using niche tags:</strong> Getting niche with your tags will grab the attention of a narrower audience, but one which is much more engaged with your business.</li><li><strong>Create your own tag:</strong> Use your own branded hashtag with your posts and promote it with contests and on other channels to get people starting to use it.</li><li><strong>Use enough hashtags:</strong> You can place up to 30 hashtags on any one post but using all 30 every time is probably a little too much. Research shows that between 9 – 11 hashtags tend to be the optimal number, but this will vary by industry.</li><li><strong>Avoid spammy hashtags:</strong> Don’t be tempted into using #like4like or #followback type tags, as although you may find you get more followers, they will be low quality and not really interested in your content.</li></ul><p>Find out more about using hashtags in our guide on <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >how to use hashtags on Instagram. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h3 id="5-Pick-the-right-time-to-post-1"><a href="#5-Pick-the-right-time-to-post-1" class="headerlink" title="5. Pick the right time to post"></a>5. Pick the right time to post</h3><p>Posting consistently is one hurdle to overcome; refining the times at which you post is another. An analysis by Tailwind looking at how to gain followers on Instagram, they found that brands who posted at least once a day grew their fans four times faster than those who only posted once a week.</p><p>Posting when your users are most active on Instagram is key to success. When your followers see your post, they’ll be compelled to interact with it with a like or a comment. This will then expose your content to more people, generating more interaction, and even more exposure. Finding out what time to post on Instagram is not always easy, but as you learn about your customers and what their schedule is like, you’ll become more aware of good times to post.</p><p>For instance, if your audience is mainly working people, they are likely to be busy checking emails and planning their days between 9 – 11 am, so that’s not a good time to post. Stay at home mums, however, may well be browsing Instagram around 9 – 10 am after the school run. B2B companies will surely find a sweet spot around 12 – 2 pm when people are on their lunch break.</p><p>Find your optimal posting time by testing posts at different times of the day. Use a scheduling tool to plan and organize your posts, but also make sure someone is available to respond to comments when the post goes live.</p><p>Check our <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >When is The Best Time to Post on Instagram <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> Guide to know more.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://bluetties.sjv.io/c/5597632/2039292/17094" target="_top" id="2039292"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17094-2039292"                      border="0" alt="BLUETTI NEW LAUNCH AC240" width="954" height="1020"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2039292/17094"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="6-Tag-other-users-1"><a href="#6-Tag-other-users-1" class="headerlink" title="6.

When working on how to get more IG followers, engaging with specific influencers is crucial. However, don’t just go randomly tagging them, as this is unlikely to get the desired response. Engage with them through their own posts, and then use this relationship to help grow your own following.</p><p>You can also get users to tag other users in your posts. Captions such as ‘tag someone who feels like this on a Monday’ or ‘tag the person you’d love to be on this beach with’ will get people tagging their friends like mad.

We absolutely cannot recommend this tactic for how to gain followers on Instagram, as it’s not good practice and won’t help you in the long run.</p><p>Fake followers are unlikely to engage with your posts, unlike real followers, so you lose all the benefits that come with healthy-looking numbers. If you have 100k followers and yet only get 200 likes when you post, it’s going to become pretty obvious that your followers are not real. Not only that, but buying followers is against Instagram’s Terms of Use, and if you get found out, you could have your account suspended.</p><p>Growing your following organically is a much better strategy, and while it does take time and commitment, it’s not the hardest thing to do.

An analysis by Tailwind looking at how to gain followers on Instagram, they found that brands who posted at least once a day grew their fans four times faster than those who only posted once a week.</p><p>Posting when your users are most active on Instagram is key to success. When your followers see your post, they’ll be compelled to interact with it with a like or a comment. This will then expose your content to more people, generating more interaction, and even more exposure. Finding out what time to post on Instagram is not always easy, but as you learn about your customers and what their schedule is like, you’ll become more aware of good times to post.</p><p>For instance, if your audience is mainly working people, they are likely to be busy checking emails and planning their days between 9 – 11 am, so that’s not a good time to post. Stay at home mums, however, may well be browsing Instagram around 9 – 10 am after the school run. B2B companies will surely find a sweet spot around 12 – 2 pm when people are on their lunch break.</p><p>Find your optimal posting time by testing posts at different times of the day.

Make it easy for users to find you"></a>1. Make it easy for users to find you</h3><p>You could have the best images, the most insightful content, and work as hard as you like on your account, but if users can’t find you, it will all be for nothing. If your fans don’t know you’re there, they are never going to follow you.</p><p>To increase your visibility, use the tools you already have in place. If you have a fan base on Facebook, Twitter, or any other social network, cross-promote your Instagram page with those people, encouraging them to follow you. Consider paying to boost these posts to ensure even more of your existing fans are driven towards your Instagram account.</p><p>You can also place a link on your website to help visitors find you on Instagram and could consider including a link in your email signatures and other public-facing profiles. When you’re keen to discover how to increase followers on Instagram, maximizing the use of existing resources is a no-brainer.</p><h3 id="2-Optimize-your-profile-3"><a href="#2-Optimize-your-profile-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Optimize your profile"></a>2. Optimize your profile</h3><p>You want your profile to be a powerful piece of marketing, so don’t scrimp on your time investment here either. Make it look professional, describe who you are and what you do, giving them a good reason to hit the ‘follow’ button.</p><p>For a start, you need to ensure your username is easy to find. Using your business name is ideal, but if it’s already taken, you’ll need to get creative. Keep your business name in the first part of the tag, so those searching for you will still be able to find you. For example, if your business is called James Retail but @jamesretail is already in use, you could use @jamesretailUSA or @jamesretailofficial.</p><p>Choose a profile picture that’s brand focussed; your logo is a great choice. Fill your bio with engaging information about your brand, but sprinkle in a bit of personality too. Add a link to your website but consider a shortened customizable link from a provider such as Bitly to make your profile as tidy as possible.</p><p>Tweaking your profile can make all the difference when it comes to how to get IG followers, so it’s a good idea to review what yours says on a relatively regular basis to ensure it’s up to date. Take a look at the profiles of some of your competition to see what’s working for them, then you can make improvements to your own.</p><h3 id="3-Tell-a-consistent-story-3"><a href="#3-Tell-a-consistent-story-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Tell a consistent story"></a>3. Tell a consistent story</h3><p>Consistency and regularity are the keys to how to get more followers on IG. Think about your brand story and purposeful content that will get your audience truly engaged. Instagram is a highly visual channel that needs perfect curation to get the very best results.</p><p>Maybe you’re all about your products; showing off how they look, demonstrating the problems they solve, or enlightening customers as to how they get made. Or perhaps you’re a service-based business, more interested in inspiring your customers with aspirational posts and motivational ideas. Whatever your brand represents, ensuring a reliable image is presented throughout all your posts will help you attract new followers, and keep them.</p><p>This doesn’t mean you have to limit your Instagram content in any way, but your posts should have a clear message and consistent ideas. Your visuals should be instantly recognizable at a glance and should present a cohesive narrative across this social channel.</p><h3 id="4-Use-hashtags-3"><a href="#4-Use-hashtags-3" class="headerlink" title="4.

You are able to advertise in both Instagram feeds and in stories, so explore all your options and test different strategies to see what works best for your business.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4665597&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.pcclean.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/winutilities-box-130521.png"                      border="0"                >WinUtilities Pro</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="10-Use-Instagram-insights-3"><a href="#10-Use-Instagram-insights-3" class="headerlink" title="10. Use Instagram insights"></a>10. Use Instagram insights</h3><p>Instagram was the last social network to really get on board with providing data, but thank goodness they do now, and we should all be using it to discover how to gain followers on Instagram. The analytics and insights provided by Instagram are absolute marketing gold dust, so take the time to get to grips with what you can discover to continue to grow your following.</p><p><strong>You May Also Like</strong> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Instagram Analytics Tools for Better Tracking Your Metrics &gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>You can view insights for your whole account using the chart button on the top right of your profile page, or for an individual post by navigating to that post and clicking ‘view insights’ in the bottom left. When you visit Insights for your account, you’ll see:</p><ul><li><strong>Impressions:</strong> How many times your ad or content appeared on feeds</li><li><strong>Reach:</strong> How many unique users have seen your posts</li><li><strong>Clicks:</strong> A count of the times people have clicked any link you’ve added to your business profile</li><li><strong>Visits:</strong> How many times your profile page has been looked at</li><li><strong>Followers:</strong> How many followers you’ve acquired or lost in the last week</li></ul><p>The ‘followers’ section will also tell you what times of day your followers are most active, which is highly informative when it comes to planning your posting times. If you choose to view insights for a particular post, you’ll be able to see:</p><ul><li><strong>Likes:</strong> How many like your post generated</li><li><strong>Comments:</strong> How many comments were left</li><li><strong>Saves:</strong> How many users saved or bookmarked your post</li><li><strong>Actions:</strong> How many actions were taken, such as visiting your profile, following you or clicking a link to your website</li><li><strong>Discovery:</strong> This metric shows where your post was seen the most, including how many accounts were not following you when they first saw you post</li></ul><p>As you can imagine, when you start drilling down into these metrics and keeping a record of data over a period of time, it’s easy to see patterns beginning to emerge. These patterns will be crucial to tailoring your strategy as you move forward, and to ensure you know how to gain followers on Instagram ongoing.</p><p>So now you know some of the right ways of how to <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >get more followers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> on IG. However, there is one way of how to get IG followers which we have not mentioned, and that’s by buying them. We absolutely cannot recommend this tactic for how to gain followers on Instagram, as it’s not good practice and won’t help you in the long run.</p><p>Fake followers are unlikely to engage with your posts, unlike real followers, so you lose all the benefits that come with healthy-looking numbers. If you have 100k followers and yet only get 200 likes when you post, it’s going to become pretty obvious that your followers are not real. Not only that, but buying followers is against Instagram’s Terms of Use, and if you get found out, you could have your account suspended.</p><p>Growing your following organically is a much better strategy, and while it does take time and commitment, it’s not the hardest thing to do. Knuckle down, do things right and you’ll be growing your Instagram fanbase in no time.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a

Soon later, in the summer of 2019, Instagram added a new feature: you may now video chat with one or more of your friends in direct messaging without having to leave Instagram.

Sit as far away from (or as near to) the camera as possible. If you’re using a different camera, situate it close to your screen, ideally at eye level, so that while you’re looking at the screen, it appears as if you’re looking at the person you’re talking to.</li><li>Before you post personal information, think twice. This could contain things like where you reside, where you go to school, and your home address.</li><li>Protect your account information, and don’t give out your password to anybody else.

We expect businesses to experiment with using video chat to communicate with customers as Instagram develops. It can undoubtedly become a new approach to communicating with your followers to keep them involved and satisfied with your services.</p><p><strong>●</strong> Keep in mind that anyone who has sent you a direct message can video chat with you. You can easily block or mute someone who is video chatting with you to prevent them from doing so. Video conferencing is ideal for groups. You can video chat with your buddies for as long as you want if you have a good internet connection. Simply tap the red phone icon at the bottom of the screen to exit the video conversation.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Instagram is a free photo and video-sharing social networking platform.

You can even invite someone to join a video chat that is already in progress.</p><p>Now, if you’re wondering how many individuals you can video chat with, the answer is, Instagram allows you to video chat with up to 6 people.</p><h4 id="Will-Instagram-Video-Chat-Show-Your-Face-3"><a href="#Will-Instagram-Video-Chat-Show-Your-Face-3" class="headerlink" title="Will Instagram Video Chat Show Your Face?"></a>Will Instagram Video Chat Show Your Face?</h4><p>If you’re in an Instagram Direct group discussion and there’s an active Video Chat, the camera icon in the top-right corner of your thread will become blue.

Sit as far away from (or as near to) the camera as possible.

This could contain things like where you reside, where you go to school, and your home address.</li><li>Protect your account information, and don’t give out your password to anybody else. You will never be asked for your password by a YouTube employee. Don’t be deceived if someone claims to be from YouTube and contacts you.</li><li>First and foremost, obtain authorization. Before shooting or posting other people’s personal information, get their permission first.</li><li>Gor a list of tools to manage your content and experience on the site, go to the Privacy and Safety Settings page.</li><li>Take a look at some of the best practices for keeping your Google Account safe.</li><li>Google account security is improved so, Keep your accounts safe.</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://purchase.swifdoo.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=40002580&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/8b932759a5a04ddb34bf79e3f9072e4b/products/3_Product%20box%20white-1024x1024.png"                      border="0"                >SwifDoo PDF 2-Year Plan</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Conclusion-3"><a href="#Conclusion-3" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p><strong>●</strong> Making an Instagram video chat allows you to experiment with new ways to remain in touch with your friends while using the app. While Instagram video chats aren’t likely to replace WhatsApp or FaceTime, they are a terrific way to remain in touch with friends while reading through your Instagram feed.

It can undoubtedly become a new approach to communicating with your followers to keep them involved and satisfied with your services.</p><p><strong>●</strong> Keep in mind that anyone who has sent you a direct message can video chat with you.
