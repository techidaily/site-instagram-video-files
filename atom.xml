Enter your URL after tapping the paperclip icon, and then share it as your Instagram Story to lure your audience. The ‘Swipe Up’ message will be displayed at the bottom of the story.

One of the best ways to do that is by using a reliable <strong>Instagram grid maker</strong>. For instance, with an Instagram grid planner, you can come up with an overall theme for your profile or connect various posts via a puzzle. To help you elevate the creative and visual appeal of your profile, I’m going to make you familiar with the 10 best grid makers for Instagram.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: What are Instagram Grids All About?</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 2: The 6 Best Online Grid Makers for Instagram</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Part 3: Top 4 Grid Makers for Instagram [for Android and iOS]</a></li><li><a href="#part4">Part 4: How to Make an Appealing Photo Grid on Instagram?</a></li><li><a href="#part5">Part 5: Creative Ideas to Implement Instagram Grid Layouts</a></li></ul><h2 id="Part-1-What-are-Instagram-Grids-All-About"><a href="#Part-1-What-are-Instagram-Grids-All-About" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What are Instagram Grids All About?"></a>Part 1: What are Instagram Grids All About?</h2><p>You might already know that Instagram displays our posts in a 3-column layout. Therefore, to make the most of this layout, a lot of people work on the overall 3x3 grid (3 rows and 3 columns).</p><p>To catch the attention of their audience, you can come up with an overall theme for your profile using 9 posts (a 3x3 grid). For instance, you can see here is a perfect example of a puzzle grid in which some parts of a post are overlapping on the adjacent posts. This would make the overall profile look uniform and more aesthetically pleasing.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/what-are-instagram-grids.jpg"                      alt="what are instagram grids"                ></p><p>Just like this, there can be so many ways in which we can plan the layout of a grid for our Instagram profile.</p><h2 id="Part-2-The-6-Best-Online-Grid-Makers-for-Instagram"><a href="#Part-2-The-6-Best-Online-Grid-Makers-for-Instagram" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: The 6 Best Online Grid Makers for Instagram"></a>Part 2: The 6 Best Online Grid Makers for Instagram</h2><p>In case you are also looking for an online Instagram grid maker, then you can simply explore these options:</p><h4 id="1-My-Social-Boutique"><a href="#1-My-Social-Boutique" class="headerlink" title="1.My Social Boutique"></a>1.<a class="link"   href="https://mysocialboutique.co/" >My Social Boutique <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>If you are looking for free or paid Instagram grid templates, then you can head to My Social Boutique.

You can use either of these Instagram grid makers online or app solutions to meet your requirements. Out of them, let’s consider the example of Image Splitter by Postcron to make a grid for your Instagram account.</p><p>Since Image Splitter is a free online Instagram grid planner, it will let you come up with stunning grids for your account on the go. To use this free photo grid Instagram tool, just go through these steps:</p><p><strong>Step 1: Upload the image you want to split</strong></p><p>At first, you can just go to the official website of Image Splitter by Postcron and click on the “Upload Image” button from its home. This will open a dedicated Instagram grid maker online tool.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/upload-image-splitter.jpg"                      alt="upload image splitter"                ></p><p>You can now just drag and drop an image that you want to split or click on the “Upload” button to browse and load it from your computer.</p><p><strong>Step 2: Choose how you want to split the image</strong></p><p>Great! Once the image has been loaded, you can simply check its preview on the side. Now, you can just crop the part of the image that you want to split from here. On the side, you can just enter the number of rows and columns in which you want to split the image. For instance, to get a 3x3 Instagram grid layout, you can set the number of columns and rows as 3.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/choose-how-split-image.jpg"                      alt="choose how split image"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3: Split your image and save all photos</strong></p><p>After setting a preferred ratio for the grid, you can also select a respective image format to export your files (like JPG or PNG). In the end, just click on the “Split Image” button and wait as the application would split your photos in a specific ratio.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/split-image-save-photo.jpg"                      alt="split image save photo"                ></p><p>When the process is completed, the online grid maker for Instagram will let you know.

Before IGTV was launched the maximum duration of a video on Instagram was limited to just one minute, which made this platform better suited for photos than videos. Today you can upload videos that last up to ten minutes regardless of the type of account you have, and if you own a verified account you can even share hour-long videos on your channel. In case you were trying to find out how you can shoot IGTV videos with your Smartphone or DSLR camera, you’re at the right place because in this article we are going to show you how to create videos that are going to impress your followers.</p><h2 id="How-to-Record-IGTV-Videos-With-a-Smartphone"><a href="#How-to-Record-IGTV-Videos-With-a-Smartphone" class="headerlink" title="How to Record IGTV Videos With a Smartphone?"></a>How to Record IGTV Videos With a Smartphone?</h2><p>Before you can actually start uploading videos to IGTV, you first need to create your own channel. Once you’ve managed this step, you can then proceed to check if you have all the equipment you need to record a video. Obviously, you’re going to need a Smartphone that has a relatively <strong>powerful rear camera capable of capturing videos in HD or Ultra HD quality</strong>. You can only upload <strong>vertically oriented videos</strong> to IGTV, which is why it is slightly easier to record an IGTV video with a Smartphone than it is with a DSLR camera.</p><p>However, iPhones and Android devices are incredibly light and keeping them perfectly steady in your hand while recording is often difficult. That’s why you need a <strong>tripod for your Smartphone</strong> that will ensure that the footage is free of camera shakes. Both iOS and Android-based devices have their <strong>native camera app</strong> you can use to record IGTV videos, but if you would like to have <strong>professional camera features</strong> at your disposal during video recording sessions you should consider installing an app like <a class="link"   href="http://promovieapp.com/" >ProMovie <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or <a class="link"   href="http://cinemafv5.com/" >Cinema FV-5 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> on your phone.</p><p><strong>Built-in microphones on Smartphones</strong> often pick up background noises or capture sound in low quality, so if you’re shooting your IGTV videos in less than perfect conditions, using an <strong>external microphone</strong> instead of the one on your phone might improve the quality of your video significantly. Optionally, you can skip recoding audio altogether and add music to your IGTV videos in the post-production.</p><p>The type of video you’re trying to create determines which pieces of equipment you’re going to need, since shooting a simple video of you walking down the street is quite different from recording an interview.</p><p><strong>You may also like:</strong> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >&gt;&gt; Blue Screen VS Green Screen: All You Need to Know <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="How-to-Shoot-IGTV-Videos-With-a-DSLR-Camera"><a href="#How-to-Shoot-IGTV-Videos-With-a-DSLR-Camera" class="headerlink" title="How to Shoot IGTV Videos With a DSLR Camera?"></a>How to Shoot IGTV Videos With a DSLR Camera?</h2><p>Learning how to operate a DLSR camera takes time and practice, so in order to capture professional-looking videos, you need to use the camera as often as you can. Adjusting the exposure value or pulling focus manually may seem difficult when you first start producing videos, but learning how to do these things will make you a better cinematographer, and it will enable you to create brilliant content for your IGTV channel.</p><p>All you need to do when recording a video for IGTV is to <strong>turn your camera horizontally</strong>, in order to capture the video in the <strong>aspect ratio that matches the aspect ratio supported by the IGTV platform</strong>. Keep in mind that videos are commonly recorded in the landscape format and that you should only shoot vertical videos if you want to upload them to a platform like IGTV that only lets its users upload videos in the portrait format.</p><p>Unlike smartphones, DSLR cameras allow you to <strong>change the lens</strong>, which enables you to create a certain visual style by simply using a lens with a different focal length. In most cases, you’ll want to use a <strong>standard 18-55mm lens</strong> to record your IGTV videos because this type of lens can be used for a wide variety of different scenes. <strong>Ultra-wide lenses</strong> can create an entertaining effect by distorting the space depicted in the video, and they are often used to create video content for social media platforms.</p><p>Shooting videos on DSLR cameras also mean that you need access to a <strong>video editing software</strong>, because the raw footage often contains parts you don’t want to include in the final cut of your video. Professional video editing software products like <strong>Final Cut Pro or Premiere Pro</strong> may be too challenging for inexperienced video editors, and if you are still learning the ropes of the trade you should try using a less demanding video editing app for Mac and PC computers like <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or <a class="link"   href="https://www.cyberlink.com/products/powerdirector-video-editing-software/features%5Fen%5FUS.html" >PowerDirector <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. The editing room is where your next IGTV video is going to get its final form, and you shouldn’t skip this step of the video production process just because it is time-consuming.

Keep in mind that videos are commonly recorded in the landscape format and that you should only shoot vertical videos if you want to upload them to a platform like IGTV that only lets its users upload videos in the portrait format.</p><p>Unlike smartphones, DSLR cameras allow you to <strong>change the lens</strong>, which enables you to create a certain visual style by simply using a lens with a different focal length. In most cases, you’ll want to use a <strong>standard 18-55mm lens</strong> to record your IGTV videos because this type of lens can be used for a wide variety of different scenes. <strong>Ultra-wide lenses</strong> can create an entertaining effect by distorting the space depicted in the video, and they are often used to create video content for social media platforms.</p><p>Shooting videos on DSLR cameras also mean that you need access to a <strong>video editing software</strong>, because the raw footage often contains parts you don’t want to include in the final cut of your video. Professional video editing software products like <strong>Final Cut Pro or Premiere Pro</strong> may be too challenging for inexperienced video editors, and if you are still learning the ropes of the trade you should try using a less demanding video editing app for Mac and PC computers like <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or <a class="link"   href="https://www.cyberlink.com/products/powerdirector-video-editing-software/features%5Fen%5FUS.html" >PowerDirector <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. The editing room is where your next IGTV video is going to get its final form, and you shouldn’t skip this step of the video production process just because it is time-consuming. If you want to impress your audience on IGTV you should work slowly and relentlessly on your footage until you are perfectly happy with the result.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                ></a><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                ></a></p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>You don’t have to be a professional in order to record an IGTV video, but you still need to have at least basic knowledge about how cameras work and how you can use them to create vertical videos.

The app has made it huge in the social media game, with roughly 1 billion official app users and 500 million daily active users of IG stories. By just creating an Instagram account, people may share videos directly from their cell phones. However, because Instagram allows for varied video lengths, figuring out <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >how to post videos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> might be difficult. There is a specific time limit for each video genre. All of those video forms, including Instagram feed and story videos, IG Live and IGTV, Instagram reels, and ad videos, will be covered in this article.</p><p>We’ll start by discussing what we mean by “Instagram video.” Instagram video encompasses the Instagram feed, Instagram Stories, Instagram Live, and Instagram advertisements, among other things. Instagram continues to expand at a rapid pace as more consumers and organizations migrate to mobile. Businesses are flocking to Instagram since it has shown to be successful. That’s not all, though as millions of businesses join Instagram, the chances of you running into competition increase. Businesses need to have a presence on Facebook because their customers expect it and search for them there, and the same is true of Instagram.</p><h4 id="In-this-article"><a href="#In-this-article" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 <a href="#part1">How Long Can An Instagram Video Be?</a></p><p>02 <a href="#part2">How Do You Adjust The Duration Of Your Video For Instagram?</a></p><p>03 <a href="#part3">Tutorial for How to Record on GarageBand</a></p><h2 id="How-Long-Can-An-Instagram-Video-Be"><a href="#How-Long-Can-An-Instagram-Video-Be" class="headerlink" title="How Long Can An Instagram Video Be?"></a>How Long Can An Instagram Video Be?</h2><p>Instagram feed videos, Instagram Story videos, IGTV videos, Instagram advertising, and Instagram Live have various length limitations. We’ve broken down Instagram video length details for each of them in this guide.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/instagram-video-length-1.png"                      alt="instagram video length"                ></p><h4 id="Instagram-Story-Video"><a href="#Instagram-Story-Video" class="headerlink" title="Instagram Story Video"></a>Instagram Story Video</h4><p>Instagram Stories are full-screen, vertical photographs and videos that vanish after 24 hours. Rather than appearing in the news feed, they appear at the top of the Instagram app. To make your material stand out, they use interactive features like stickers, polls, and Instagram Story filters.</p><p>Each Instagram Story has a length of 15-second time limit. If you upload a video that is longer than 15 seconds, they will automatically cut it into 15-second segments. However, based on testing, it appears that you’ll only receive four 15-second parts. Thus, this is only suitable for recordings under one minute.</p><p>Furthermore, to use the new feature and make lengthier Instagram Stories, simply tap the Your Story symbol and then press and hold the record button in the bottom-right corner for as long as you want to record a moment - without worrying about the 15-second limit.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/instagram-video-length-2.png"                      alt="instgarm story video length"                ></p><h4 id="Instagram-Reels"><a href="#Instagram-Reels" class="headerlink" title="Instagram Reels"></a>Instagram Reels</h4><p>Instagram’s newest feature is Reels. It also allows you to share small video snippets (up to 15 seconds in length) with all Instagram users. Before publishing your Reel, you can dub audio, tweak footage, and add instant effects. The Reel video will then appear in your followers’ feeds.</p><p>Instagram Reels length is now limited to 60 seconds in duration. Previously, the maximum length was 30 seconds, however owing to competition from TikTok, Instagram decided to raise it. TikTok, one of the platform’s main competitors, recently increased the video length limit to three minutes.</p><p>To use this feature, go to Create a New Reel and then press the left-hand down button to see the menu. To construct a reel, tap “length” to choose between settings.</p><h4 id="IGTV-Video-On-Instagram"><a href="#IGTV-Video-On-Instagram" class="headerlink" title="IGTV Video On Instagram"></a>IGTV Video On Instagram</h4><p>Creators can upload high-quality, long-form, vertical videos to Instagram TV, also known as IGTV. Users may use IGTV to generate more engaging content for their audiences. Because social media is all about sharing interesting content, IGTV is worth looking into.</p><p>Instagram’s IGTV section allows users to upload and view longer videos. IGTV videos length is of 15 minutes long on the Instagram mobile app and up to an hour-long on the Instagram website. And because these films are posts, they won’t vanish after a day as Stories do.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/instagram-video-length-3.png"                      alt="IGTV video length"                ></p><h4 id="IG-Feed-Video"><a href="#IG-Feed-Video" class="headerlink" title="IG Feed Video"></a>IG Feed Video</h4><p>The videos you submit to your main Instagram page, rather than your Stories, are referred to as Instagram feed videos. These appear on your followers’ Instagram feeds as well as on your main profile page.</p><p>Videos can only be 1 minute or 60 seconds long when posted to the Instagram feed. In addition, if you wish to submit a video to your Instagram feed or profile, you must keep it under 60 seconds. If you have a longer than a minute video, you must use the app to select a 60-second frame and post it to your feed. You can trim the video and choose your favorite parts utilizing the app’s built-in editor.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/instagram-video-length-4.png"                      alt="IG Feed video length"                ></p><h4 id="IG-Feed-Video-Ads"><a href="#IG-Feed-Video-Ads" class="headerlink" title="IG Feed Video Ads"></a>IG Feed Video Ads</h4><p>The videos you submit to your main Instagram page, rather than your Stories, are referred to as Instagram feed videos. These appear on your followers’ Instagram feeds as well as on your main profile page.</p><p>If you want to share a video on your Instagram feed or profile, you must keep it under 60 seconds. If you have a longer than a minute video, you must use the app to select a 60-second frame and post it to your feed. You can trim the video and choose your favorite parts using the app’s built-in editor. You can then post it immediately to your profile. To do so, go to your profile and click the ‘+’ icon. Choose the video you wish to share and then click ‘next.’ That concludes the discussion. You can now share the movie on your social media accounts with an interesting caption.</p><h4 id="IG-Story-Video-Ads"><a href="#IG-Story-Video-Ads" class="headerlink" title="IG Story Video Ads"></a>IG Story Video Ads</h4><p>Instagram Stories advertisements are an excellent method to reach out to new people while also showcasing your brand, company, and products to an already engaged audience. Instagram Stories already have excellent engagement rates, with one out of every five stories receiving a direct reply from viewers.</p><p>The maximum length of an Instagram Story video ad is two minutes. You can utilize different story cards if you want to show your ad on an Instagram story. Each card can display a 15-second video or a single 5-second picture ad. Only the first three cards of a complete ad will appear in the Instagram story stream. After that, after touching on the ad, the viewer must choose whether or not to see more.</p><p>Furthermore, Instagram Stories will show 15-second or shorter video advertising for the duration of the video. Video ads lasting more than 10 seconds will be broken into different Stories cards.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://dhgate.sjv.io/c/5597632/1175223/12108" target="_top" id="1175223">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/12108-1175223" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://dhgate.sjv.io/i/5597632/1175223/12108"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-Do-You-Adjust-The-Duration-Of-Your-Video-For-Instagram"><a href="#How-Do-You-Adjust-The-Duration-Of-Your-Video-For-Instagram" class="headerlink" title="How Do You Adjust The Duration Of Your Video For Instagram?"></a>How Do You Adjust The Duration Of Your Video For Instagram?</h2><p>You must be thinking about how to upload flawlessly every time with all of these time limits and video publication options. Here are some helpful hints:</p><ul><li>If you’re worried your IG Feed video is too long and don’t want to edit it, make a video carousel post by breaking it up into smaller chunks. By swiping the post, the viewer will be able to see everything.</li><li>If you felt pressed to stay inside the time limit and made a video that was far too short, you can add more footage, slow it down, or add a loop. Another option is to use a video editor to make an intro and an end screen.</li><li>If your Instagram story is too long, you can cut it down using any Instagram video editor. Record the video, then open it in your app to edit and trim it down before selecting the clips to upload the full story.</li><li>In addition, if your Instagram ad video is longer than 15 seconds, Instagram provides 10 cards, each with a 15-second video duration limit. This will allow you to show your complete advertisement without compressing it.</li><li>The four-hour limit seems insufficient if you wish to have a more extended live stream on Instagram. Then, as soon as you reach the time restriction, you can easily go live again and re-start the stream as many times as you wish.</li><li>To make videos that will receive hundreds of likes on Instagram, you’ll need video editing software that allows you to change the aspect ratio of the videos you wish to submit. Wondershare Filmora is a video editing program that supports a wide range of video file formats and allows you to crop and prepare your videos for web use.</li></ul><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For Win 7 or later (64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For macOS 10.12 or later</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p><strong>●</strong> That’s all there is to know about the length of Instagram videos.

If you upload a video that is longer than 15 seconds, they will automatically cut it into 15-second segments. However, based on testing, it appears that you’ll only receive four 15-second parts.

The Reel video will then appear in your followers’ feeds.</p><p>Instagram Reels length is now limited to 60 seconds in duration. Previously, the maximum length was 30 seconds, however owing to competition from TikTok, Instagram decided to raise it. TikTok, one of the platform’s main competitors, recently increased the video length limit to three minutes.</p><p>To use this feature, go to Create a New Reel and then press the left-hand down button to see the menu.

IGTV videos length is of 15 minutes long on the Instagram mobile app and up to an hour-long on the Instagram website.

In addition, if you wish to submit a video to your Instagram feed or profile, you must keep it under 60 seconds.

You can utilize different story cards if you want to show your ad on an Instagram story. Each card can display a 15-second video or a single 5-second picture ad.

The app has made it huge in the social media game, with roughly 1 billion official app users and 500 million daily active users of IG stories. By just creating an Instagram account, people may share videos directly from their cell phones. However, because Instagram allows for varied video lengths, figuring out <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >how to post videos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> might be difficult. There is a specific time limit for each video genre. All of those video forms, including Instagram feed and story videos, IG Live and IGTV, Instagram reels, and ad videos, will be covered in this article.</p><p>We’ll start by discussing what we mean by “Instagram video.” Instagram video encompasses the Instagram feed, Instagram Stories, Instagram Live, and Instagram advertisements, among other things. Instagram continues to expand at a rapid pace as more consumers and organizations migrate to mobile. Businesses are flocking to Instagram since it has shown to be successful. That’s not all, though as millions of businesses join Instagram, the chances of you running into competition increase. Businesses need to have a presence on Facebook because their customers expect it and search for them there, and the same is true of Instagram.</p><h4 id="In-this-article-3"><a href="#In-this-article-3" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 <a href="#part1">How Long Can An Instagram Video Be?</a></p><p>02 <a href="#part2">How Do You Adjust The Duration Of Your Video For Instagram?</a></p><p>03 <a href="#part3">Tutorial for How to Record on GarageBand</a></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2049387/7443" target="_top" id="2049387">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2049387" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2049387/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-Long-Can-An-Instagram-Video-Be-3"><a href="#How-Long-Can-An-Instagram-Video-Be-3" class="headerlink" title="How Long Can An Instagram Video Be?"></a>How Long Can An Instagram Video Be?</h2><p>Instagram feed videos, Instagram Story videos, IGTV videos, Instagram advertising, and Instagram Live have various length limitations. We’ve broken down Instagram video length details for each of them in this guide.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/instagram-video-length-1.png"                      alt="instagram video length"                ></p><h4 id="Instagram-Story-Video-3"><a href="#Instagram-Story-Video-3" class="headerlink" title="Instagram Story Video"></a>Instagram Story Video</h4><p>Instagram Stories are full-screen, vertical photographs and videos that vanish after 24 hours. Rather than appearing in the news feed, they appear at the top of the Instagram app. To make your material stand out, they use interactive features like stickers, polls, and Instagram Story filters.</p><p>Each Instagram Story has a length of 15-second time limit. If you upload a video that is longer than 15 seconds, they will automatically cut it into 15-second segments. However, based on testing, it appears that you’ll only receive four 15-second parts. Thus, this is only suitable for recordings under one minute.</p><p>Furthermore, to use the new feature and make lengthier Instagram Stories, simply tap the Your Story symbol and then press and hold the record button in the bottom-right corner for as long as you want to record a moment - without worrying about the 15-second limit.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/instagram-video-length-2.png"                      alt="instgarm story video length"                ></p><h4 id="Instagram-Reels-3"><a href="#Instagram-Reels-3" class="headerlink" title="Instagram Reels"></a>Instagram Reels</h4><p>Instagram’s newest feature is Reels. It also allows you to share small video snippets (up to 15 seconds in length) with all Instagram users. Before publishing your Reel, you can dub audio, tweak footage, and add instant effects. The Reel video will then appear in your followers’ feeds.</p><p>Instagram Reels length is now limited to 60 seconds in duration. Previously, the maximum length was 30 seconds, however owing to competition from TikTok, Instagram decided to raise it. TikTok, one of the platform’s main competitors, recently increased the video length limit to three minutes.</p><p>To use this feature, go to Create a New Reel and then press the left-hand down button to see the menu. To construct a reel, tap “length” to choose between settings.</p><h4 id="IGTV-Video-On-Instagram-3"><a href="#IGTV-Video-On-Instagram-3" class="headerlink" title="IGTV Video On Instagram"></a>IGTV Video On Instagram</h4><p>Creators can upload high-quality, long-form, vertical videos to Instagram TV, also known as IGTV. Users may use IGTV to generate more engaging content for their audiences. Because social media is all about sharing interesting content, IGTV is worth looking into.</p><p>Instagram’s IGTV section allows users to upload and view longer videos. IGTV videos length is of 15 minutes long on the Instagram mobile app and up to an hour-long on the Instagram website. And because these films are posts, they won’t vanish after a day as Stories do.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/instagram-video-length-3.png"                      alt="IGTV video length"                ></p><h4 id="IG-Feed-Video-3"><a href="#IG-Feed-Video-3" class="headerlink" title="IG Feed Video"></a>IG Feed Video</h4><p>The videos you submit to your main Instagram page, rather than your Stories, are referred to as Instagram feed videos. These appear on your followers’ Instagram feeds as well as on your main profile page.</p><p>Videos can only be 1 minute or 60 seconds long when posted to the Instagram feed. In addition, if you wish to submit a video to your Instagram feed or profile, you must keep it under 60 seconds. If you have a longer than a minute video, you must use the app to select a 60-second frame and post it to your feed. You can trim the video and choose your favorite parts utilizing the app’s built-in editor.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/instagram-video-length-4.png"                      alt="IG Feed video length"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135410/19272" target="_top" id="2135410">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135410" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="160" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135410/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h4 id="IG-Feed-Video-Ads-3"><a href="#IG-Feed-Video-Ads-3" class="headerlink" title="IG Feed Video Ads"></a>IG Feed Video Ads</h4><p>The videos you submit to your main Instagram page, rather than your Stories, are referred to as Instagram feed videos. These appear on your followers’ Instagram feeds as well as on your main profile page.</p><p>If you want to share a video on your Instagram feed or profile, you must keep it under 60 seconds. If you have a longer than a minute video, you must use the app to select a 60-second frame and post it to your feed. You can trim the video and choose your favorite parts using the app’s built-in editor. You can then post it immediately to your profile. To do so, go to your profile and click the ‘+’ icon. Choose the video you wish to share and then click ‘next.’ That concludes the discussion. You can now share the movie on your social media accounts with an interesting caption.</p><h4 id="IG-Story-Video-Ads-3"><a href="#IG-Story-Video-Ads-3" class="headerlink" title="IG Story Video Ads"></a>IG Story Video Ads</h4><p>Instagram Stories advertisements are an excellent method to reach out to new people while also showcasing your brand, company, and products to an already engaged audience. Instagram Stories already have excellent engagement rates, with one out of every five stories receiving a direct reply from viewers.</p><p>The maximum length of an Instagram Story video ad is two minutes. You can utilize different story cards if you want to show your ad on an Instagram story. Each card can display a 15-second video or a single 5-second picture ad. Only the first three cards of a complete ad will appear in the Instagram story stream. After that, after touching on the ad, the viewer must choose whether or not to see more.</p><p>Furthermore, Instagram Stories will show 15-second or shorter video advertising for the duration of the video. Video ads lasting more than 10 seconds will be broken into different Stories cards.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1885928/19272" target="_top" id="1885928">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1885928" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1885928/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-Do-You-Adjust-The-Duration-Of-Your-Video-For-Instagram-3"><a href="#How-Do-You-Adjust-The-Duration-Of-Your-Video-For-Instagram-3" class="headerlink" title="How Do You Adjust The Duration Of Your Video For Instagram?"></a>How Do You Adjust The Duration Of Your Video For Instagram?</h2><p>You must be thinking about how to upload flawlessly every time with all of these time limits and video publication options. Here are some helpful hints:</p><ul><li>If you’re worried your IG Feed video is too long and don’t want to edit it, make a video carousel post by breaking it up into smaller chunks. By swiping the post, the viewer will be able to see everything.</li><li>If you felt pressed to stay inside the time limit and made a video that was far too short, you can add more footage, slow it down, or add a loop. Another option is to use a video editor to make an intro and an end screen.</li><li>If your Instagram story is too long, you can cut it down using any Instagram video editor. Record the video, then open it in your app to edit and trim it down before selecting the clips to upload the full story.</li><li>In addition, if your Instagram ad video is longer than 15 seconds, Instagram provides 10 cards, each with a 15-second video duration limit. This will allow you to show your complete advertisement without compressing it.</li><li>The four-hour limit seems insufficient if you wish to have a more extended live stream on Instagram. Then, as soon as you reach the time restriction, you can easily go live again and re-start the stream as many times as you wish.</li><li>To make videos that will receive hundreds of likes on Instagram, you’ll need video editing software that allows you to change the aspect ratio of the videos you wish to submit.

This new feature is called ‘Carousel’. Basically, when you upload multiple photos via carousel, they appear in a single post in the feed. There will be a row of blue dots underneath the pictures to let others know that they can swipe left and right through the slideshow to view the photos.</p><p> You can now organize and post your photos about an expedition or some memorable event etc. in one single post and boast about your experiences in a more sequential and connective way to efficiently capture your audience’s attention. Since this feature lets you add a series of videos as well, you can incorporate up to 10 videos in a single post and hence post a video content for up to 10 minutes.</p><h2 id="How-to-Upload-Multiple-Videos-and-Photos-to-Instagram-3"><a href="#How-to-Upload-Multiple-Videos-and-Photos-to-Instagram-3" class="headerlink" title="How to Upload Multiple Videos and Photos to Instagram"></a>How to Upload Multiple Videos and Photos to Instagram</h2><p> Here in this section we have brought you with the detailed guide on how one can upload up to 10 images or videos or a combination of both in a single Instagram post –</p><ul><li>Launch your Instagram app and hit the ‘+’ sign at the bottom.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/upload-mutiple-photo-to-ins-1.png"                                     ></p><ul><li>As soon as you tap it, you will be able to see the recent photos and videos in your phone.

Though, if you are running out of ideas to post, then here are some poll questions for Instagram that you can consider.</p><ul><li><em>Asking about a location</em></li></ul><p>You can just post a picture of a place you have visited (like a famous monument or a city) and ask your audience if they have been to that place or not.</p><ul><li><em>Instagram Poll Questions on Food</em></li></ul><p>Content related to food always performs well on Instagram. Therefore, you can post a photo of a dish that you have made and ask your audience whether they like it or not. You can even ask whether they would like you to share its recipe.</p><ul><li><em>This or That</em></li></ul><p>You can find these poll questions for Instagram on almost every story these days. If you want, you can share a before and after look, pictures of two dresses, or anything else. Ask your audience which option they like the post.</p><ul><li><em>Can you relate?</em></li></ul><p>These are some of the most interesting Instagram poll questions that you can post. Simply post a picture of a situation that you are in and ask your audience whether they can relate to it. You would be surprised to know how many other people can relate to the same situation.</p><ul><li><em>Love or Hate</em></li></ul><p>This is similar to the “This or That” category, but the focus is on a single thing instead of two options. Just post a picture of a product and ask your audience whether they like it or not.</p><ul><li><em>Rating on a Scale</em></li></ul><p>Apart from a simple yes&#x2F;no poll, Instagram also lets us post a scale widget for a question.

Though, if you are running out of ideas to post, then here are some poll questions for Instagram that you can consider.</p><ul><li><em>Asking about a location</em></li></ul><p>You can just post a picture of a place you have visited (like a famous monument or a city) and ask your audience if they have been to that place or not.</p><ul><li><em>Instagram Poll Questions on Food</em></li></ul><p>Content related to food always performs well on Instagram. Therefore, you can post a photo of a dish that you have made and ask your audience whether they like it or not. You can even ask whether they would like you to share its recipe.</p><ul><li><em>This or That</em></li></ul><p>You can find these poll questions for Instagram on almost every story these days. If you want, you can share a before and after look, pictures of two dresses, or anything else. Ask your audience which option they like the post.</p><ul><li><em>Can you relate?</em></li></ul><p>These are some of the most interesting Instagram poll questions that you can post. Simply post a picture of a situation that you are in and ask your audience whether they can relate to it. You would be surprised to know how many other people can relate to the same situation.</p><ul><li><em>Love or Hate</em></li></ul><p>This is similar to the “This or That” category, but the focus is on a single thing instead of two options. Just post a picture of a product and ask your audience whether they like it or not.</p><ul><li><em>Rating on a Scale</em></li></ul><p>Apart from a simple yes&#x2F;no poll, Instagram also lets us post a scale widget for a question.

Just post about something and ask your audience whether they agree to it or it.

For instance, if your brand is working on a new line of products and you are not sure about something, then why not post it on Instagram. In this way, you can know the feedback of its end-users and would help in the product’s development as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/get-instant-ig-poll-feedback.jpg"                      alt="Instant Instagram Poll Feedback"                ></p><h4 id="2-Be-Creative-2"><a href="#2-Be-Creative-2" class="headerlink" title="2.

Instead of posting a simple yes&#x2F;no poll, why not use emojis.</p><p>Let’s consider that you manage the Instagram profile of a beverage brand. Why not post a picture of a beach and ask your audience which beverage of yours they would enjoy the most. This would be quite an interesting post and will improve the engagement rate on your profile.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/creative-ig-poll.jpg"                      alt="Creative Instagram Poll"                ></p><h4 id="3-Redirect-your-audience-2"><a href="#3-Redirect-your-audience-2" class="headerlink" title="3.

Though, apart from simply posting your products, you can ask your audience their opinion about it. Besides that, you can also include your website’s link or a DM option on the story. This will help you redirect your audience to your product page and can increase its sales as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/redirect-audience-ig-poll.jpg"                      alt="redirect audience Instagram Poll"                ></p><h4 id="4-Think-Beyond-Polls-2"><a href="#4-Think-Beyond-Polls-2" class="headerlink" title="4.

You can consider posting a question as well to directly interact with your audience.</p><p>Not just that, you can also use a slider widget with a poll (or even without it). Instead of just selecting yes or no, this will let your audience slide their choice to a preferred value and will further spike their interest.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/think-beyond-poll.jpg"                      alt="Think Beyond Polls"                ></p><p>There you go!

Be Creative"></a>2. Be Creative</h4><p>You might already know there are so many ways to do Instagram polls these days. Though, if you want your content to stand out, then try to be a bit creative. Instead of posting a simple yes&#x2F;no poll, why not use emojis.</p><p>Let’s consider that you manage the Instagram profile of a beverage brand. Why not post a picture of a beach and ask your audience which beverage of yours they would enjoy the most. This would be quite an interesting post and will improve the engagement rate on your profile.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/creative-ig-poll.jpg"                      alt="Creative Instagram Poll"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://malaysia-healthcare-travel-council.pxf.io/c/5597632/1576477/17382" target="_top" id="1576477">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17382-1576477" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="160" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://malaysia-healthcare-travel-council.pxf.io/i/5597632/1576477/17382"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h4 id="3-Redirect-your-audience-3"><a href="#3-Redirect-your-audience-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Redirect your audience"></a>3. Redirect your audience</h4><p>Product placement is one of the major things that you should consider doing in Instagram Polls. Though, apart from simply posting your products, you can ask your audience their opinion about it. Besides that, you can also include your website’s link or a DM option on the story. This will help you redirect your audience to your product page and can increase its sales as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/redirect-audience-ig-poll.jpg"                      alt="redirect audience Instagram Poll"                ></p><h4 id="4-Think-Beyond-Polls-3"><a href="#4-Think-Beyond-Polls-3" class="headerlink" title="4. Think Beyond Polls"></a>4. Think Beyond Polls</h4><p>While Instagram Polls are undoubtedly one of the best ways to engage with your audience, there are plenty of other features that you can try. You can consider posting a question as well to directly interact with your audience.</p><p>Not just that, you can also use a slider widget with a poll (or even without it). Instead of just selecting yes or no, this will let your audience slide their choice to a preferred value and will further spike their interest.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/think-beyond-poll.jpg"                      alt="Think Beyond Polls"                ></p><p>There you go!

If you want, you can also come up with a puzzle feed on Instagram via Canva from scratch. It is a freely available online editor that offers tons of templates and options to create social media posts.</p><p>Here’s how you can also come up with a customizable puzzle feed for Instagram using Canva:</p><p><strong>Step 1: Choose to work on a custom design on Canva</strong></p><p>At first, you can just go to the official website of Canva, log in to your account, and choose to work on a Custom Design from its home. Here, you can enter the size as 3240x3240 pixels to work on a set of 3x3 images (since an ideal Instagram post is of 1080x1080 pixels).</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/login-canva-make-puzzle-feed.jpg"                      alt="login canva make puzzle feed"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2: Add Grids to your Custom Design on Canva</strong></p><p>This will simply open a new canvas on your interface so that you can add all kinds of elements. Now, go to the sidebar and under the Elements section, look for “Grids”. From here, you can add a 3x3 grid to get 9 equal images. If you want, you can make a grid and canvas of any other preferred size as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/add-grids-to-puzzle-feed.jpg"                      alt="add grids to puzzle feed"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3: Add Elements and Photos to your Grid</strong></p><p>Once the grid is created, you can just drag and drop all kinds of elements or pictures on it. At first, I would recommend adding photos so that you can easily place them and get their right placement on the canvas.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/add-elements-to-grid.jpg"                      alt="add elements to grid"                ></p><p>Following the same approach, you can find all kinds of elements on the sidebar that you can add to your grid.

It is a freely available online editor that offers tons of templates and options to create social media posts.</p><p>Here’s how you can also come up with a customizable puzzle feed for Instagram using Canva:</p><p><strong>Step 1: Choose to work on a custom design on Canva</strong></p><p>At first, you can just go to the official website of Canva, log in to your account, and choose to work on a Custom Design from its home. Here, you can enter the size as 3240x3240 pixels to work on a set of 3x3 images (since an ideal Instagram post is of 1080x1080 pixels).</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/login-canva-make-puzzle-feed.jpg"                      alt="login canva make puzzle feed"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2: Add Grids to your Custom Design on Canva</strong></p><p>This will simply open a new canvas on your interface so that you can add all kinds of elements. Now, go to the sidebar and under the Elements section, look for “Grids”. From here, you can add a 3x3 grid to get 9 equal images. If you want, you can make a grid and canvas of any other preferred size as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/add-grids-to-puzzle-feed.jpg"                      alt="add grids to puzzle feed"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3: Add Elements and Photos to your Grid</strong></p><p>Once the grid is created, you can just drag and drop all kinds of elements or pictures on it. At first, I would recommend adding photos so that you can easily place them and get their right placement on the canvas.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/add-elements-to-grid.jpg"                      alt="add elements to grid"                ></p><p>Following the same approach, you can find all kinds of elements on the sidebar that you can add to your grid.

If you want, you can also come up with a puzzle feed on Instagram via Canva from scratch. It is a freely available online editor that offers tons of templates and options to create social media posts.</p><p>Here’s how you can also come up with a customizable puzzle feed for Instagram using Canva:</p><p><strong>Step 1: Choose to work on a custom design on Canva</strong></p><p>At first, you can just go to the official website of Canva, log in to your account, and choose to work on a Custom Design from its home. Here, you can enter the size as 3240x3240 pixels to work on a set of 3x3 images (since an ideal Instagram post is of 1080x1080 pixels).</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/login-canva-make-puzzle-feed.jpg"                      alt="login canva make puzzle feed"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2: Add Grids to your Custom Design on Canva</strong></p><p>This will simply open a new canvas on your interface so that you can add all kinds of elements. Now, go to the sidebar and under the Elements section, look for “Grids”. From here, you can add a 3x3 grid to get 9 equal images. If you want, you can make a grid and canvas of any other preferred size as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/add-grids-to-puzzle-feed.jpg"                      alt="add grids to puzzle feed"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://imp.i110150.net/c/5597632/924297/11305" target="_top" id="924297">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/11305-924297" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.i110150.net/i/5597632/924297/11305"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><strong>Step 3: Add Elements and Photos to your Grid</strong></p><p>Once the grid is created, you can just drag and drop all kinds of elements or pictures on it. At first, I would recommend adding photos so that you can easily place them and get their right placement on the canvas.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/add-elements-to-grid.jpg"                      alt="add elements to grid"                ></p><p>Following the same approach, you can find all kinds of elements on the sidebar that you can add to your grid. For instance, you can add headlines, texts, lines, vectors, and so much more.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/add-photo-to-grid.jpg"                      alt="add photo to grid"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4: Split and Post your Photos on Instagram</strong></p><p>That’s it! Once you have worked on the entire grid, you can go to the Export button and save the entire grid image on your system. Later, you can use any free solution (like Pine Tools) to split the grid into individual 1080x1080 photos for your Instagram feed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/split-grid-ig-puzzle.jpg"                      alt="split grid ig puzzle"                ></p><p>In this way, you can easily explore your creative side to make all kinds of puzzle feeds for Instagram via Canva.</p><h2 id="Part-5-Effective-Instagram-Puzzle-Feed-Ideas-2"><a href="#Part-5-Effective-Instagram-Puzzle-Feed-Ideas-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: Effective Instagram Puzzle Feed Ideas"></a>Part 5: Effective Instagram Puzzle Feed Ideas</h2><p>As you can see, it can be quite easy to come up with a puzzle feed for Instagram on Canva.

Remember, your focus should be on your content and other elements are there to simply elevate the visual appeal of your feed.</p><h4 id="Be-Consistent-2"><a href="#Be-Consistent-2" class="headerlink" title="Be Consistent"></a>Be Consistent</h4><p>If you have just started with a puzzle theme on Instagram, then be consistent and stick to it for a while. For instance, if you would keep changing the overall theme after every 9 posts, then it will make your account look cluttered.</p><h4 id="Consider-your-account’s-theme-2"><a href="#Consider-your-account’s-theme-2" class="headerlink" title="Consider your account’s theme"></a>Consider your account’s theme</h4><p>Don’t go with any free or paid Instagram puzzle feed just because it looks appealing. You should consider the overall theme of your brand or personal account. The template should reflect the idea of your business. For instance, luxury brands can go with bold colors while fashion influencers can have some contrasting gradients on their template.</p><h3 id="Conclusion-2"><a href="#Conclusion-2" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>I’m sure that after reading this guide, you would be able to pick the perfect puzzle feed for your Instagram account.

Here, you can enter the size as 3240x3240 pixels to work on a set of 3x3 images (since an ideal Instagram post is of 1080x1080 pixels).</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/login-canva-make-puzzle-feed.jpg"                      alt="login canva make puzzle feed"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2: Add Grids to your Custom Design on Canva</strong></p><p>This will simply open a new canvas on your interface so that you can add all kinds of elements. Now, go to the sidebar and under the Elements section, look for “Grids”. From here, you can add a 3x3 grid to get 9 equal images. If you want, you can make a grid and canvas of any other preferred size as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/add-grids-to-puzzle-feed.jpg"                      alt="add grids to puzzle feed"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3: Add Elements and Photos to your Grid</strong></p><p>Once the grid is created, you can just drag and drop all kinds of elements or pictures on it. At first, I would recommend adding photos so that you can easily place them and get their right placement on the canvas.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/add-elements-to-grid.jpg"                      alt="add elements to grid"                ></p><p>Following the same approach, you can find all kinds of elements on the sidebar that you can add to your grid. For instance, you can add headlines, texts, lines, vectors, and so much more.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/add-photo-to-grid.jpg"                      alt="add photo to grid"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2044586/7443" target="_top" id="2044586">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2044586" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2044586/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><strong>Step 4: Split and Post your Photos on Instagram</strong></p><p>That’s it! Once you have worked on the entire grid, you can go to the Export button and save the entire grid image on your system. Later, you can use any free solution (like Pine Tools) to split the grid into individual 1080x1080 photos for your Instagram feed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/split-grid-ig-puzzle.jpg"                      alt="split grid ig puzzle"                ></p><p>In this way, you can easily explore your creative side to make all kinds of puzzle feeds for Instagram via Canva.</p><h2 id="Part-5-Effective-Instagram-Puzzle-Feed-Ideas-3"><a href="#Part-5-Effective-Instagram-Puzzle-Feed-Ideas-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: Effective Instagram Puzzle Feed Ideas"></a>Part 5: Effective Instagram Puzzle Feed Ideas</h2><p>As you can see, it can be quite easy to come up with a puzzle feed for Instagram on Canva.

Remember, your focus should be on your content and other elements are there to simply elevate the visual appeal of your feed.</p><h4 id="Be-Consistent-3"><a href="#Be-Consistent-3" class="headerlink" title="Be Consistent"></a>Be Consistent</h4><p>If you have just started with a puzzle theme on Instagram, then be consistent and stick to it for a while. For instance, if you would keep changing the overall theme after every 9 posts, then it will make your account look cluttered.</p><h4 id="Consider-your-account’s-theme-3"><a href="#Consider-your-account’s-theme-3" class="headerlink" title="Consider your account’s theme"></a>Consider your account’s theme</h4><p>Don’t go with any free or paid Instagram puzzle feed just because it looks appealing. You should consider the overall theme of your brand or personal account. The template should reflect the idea of your business. For instance, luxury brands can go with bold colors while fashion influencers can have some contrasting gradients on their template.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2100541/7443" target="_top" id="2100541">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2100541" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2100541/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Conclusion-3"><a href="#Conclusion-3" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>I’m sure that after reading this guide, you would be able to pick the perfect puzzle feed for your Instagram account.

Sometimes we need to accelerate the video to make it more engaging while also saving the viewer’s time. Because Instagram stories and posts have a limited length, we must speed up videos and present them as much as possible in a short amount of time.</p><p>However, most people don’t know <strong>How to Speed Up Video on Instagram</strong>, and if you’re one of them, don’t worry. This article covers an easy method to speed up the video on smartphones and computers and some online tools to assist you. Let’s get started.</p><h4 id="In-this-article"><a href="#In-this-article" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 <a href="#part1">How to Speed up Video for Instagram on iPhone with Hyperlapse?</a></p><p>02 <a href="#part2">How to Speed up Video for Instagram on Android with Filmora?</a></p><p>03 <a href="#part3">How to Speed up Video for Instagram Online for Free?</a></p><p>04 <a href="#part4">How to Speed up Video for Instagram on Computer Desktop?</a></p><p>05 <a href="#part5">How to Upload Video from Desktop to Instagram</a></p><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Speed-up-Video-for-Instagram-on-iPhone-with-Hyperlapse"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Speed-up-Video-for-Instagram-on-iPhone-with-Hyperlapse" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to Speed up Video for Instagram on iPhone with Hyperlapse?"></a>Part 1: How to Speed up Video for Instagram on iPhone with Hyperlapse?</h2><p>When speeding up Instagram videos, Hyperlapse is unquestionably the most acceptable option for iPhone users. A supplementary app (Hyperlapse) for Instagram is specifically developed to allow users to accelerate Instagram video speed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/hyperlapse-from-instagram.jpg"                      alt="hyperlapse from instagram"                ></p><p>You have the option of uploading a video from your iPhone or shooting a movie from inside the application. By default, your video is being played at a speed of 6X. This software, however, also has several drawbacks. For example, it can only assist you in increasing the pace of the videos. There are no editing features.</p><p>To know how to speed up a video for Instagram using Hyperlapse, follow these steps:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Launch Hyperlapse on your iPhone, press the <strong>record</strong> button. Stop filming anytime you wish and keep your hands motionless.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> You’ll see a speedometer now. The default speed is <strong>6X</strong>, but you may lower it to <strong>1X</strong> or boost it to <strong>12X</strong> if you choose. Move to the right to speed up the video.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Right after you’ve chosen your desired speed, click “OK.” If you want to share the video, you may do so on social media platforms like Instagram and Facebook.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Speed-up-Video-for-Instagram-on-Android-with-Filmora"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Speed-up-Video-for-Instagram-on-Android-with-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Speed up Video for Instagram on Android with Filmora?"></a>Part 2: How to Speed up Video for Instagram on Android with Filmora?</h2><p>On Android, you do not have access to the Hyperlapse application. Hence, you will need Filmora from the Google Play store. It’s one of the most well-regarded video editing tools available.</p><p>This application allows you to convert any video into a slow or fast motion video with no effort. The most attractive feature of this tool is that it allows you to speed up different segments from a single video simultaneously. However, you can only increase the video speed by a factor of two at the most.</p><p>To know how to speed up existing video for Instagram with Filmora, follow these steps:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Touch New Project to begin a new filming session at the bottom of the screen.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Choose the video you want to speed up and hit <strong>Import</strong>. After the editor is opened, you may begin editing. In the toolbar at the very bottom of the screen, choose <strong>Trim</strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/trim-instagram-video-filmorago-android.jpg"                      alt="trim instagram video filmorago android"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> You may need to slide to the left to view and click the <strong>Speed</strong> button in the toolbar. Drag the slider in the pop-up to change the video’s playing speed. You have the option of selecting any speed between.2x (slow) and 2x (fast).</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/change-instagram-speed-filmorago-android.jpg"                      alt="change instagram speed filmorago android"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2144273/7443" target="_top" id="2144273">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2144273" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2144273/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><strong>Step 5:</strong> To export the movie, just hit the Export button on the top right of the screen when you’re pleased with the results.</p><p><strong>Related</strong>: <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Best Free Slo-Mo Video Editing Apps <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Speed-up-Video-for-Instagram-Online-for-Free"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Speed-up-Video-for-Instagram-Online-for-Free" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Speed up Video for Instagram Online for Free?"></a>Part 3: How to Speed up Video for Instagram Online for Free?</h2><p>This section has you covered if you want to speed up video Instagram without downloading a video editor.
