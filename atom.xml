If you want, you can also come up with a puzzle feed on Instagram via Canva from scratch. It is a freely available online editor that offers tons of templates and options to create social media posts.</p><p>Here’s how you can also come up with a customizable puzzle feed for Instagram using Canva:</p><p><strong>Step 1: Choose to work on a custom design on Canva</strong></p><p>At first, you can just go to the official website of Canva, log in to your account, and choose to work on a Custom Design from its home. Here, you can enter the size as 3240x3240 pixels to work on a set of 3x3 images (since an ideal Instagram post is of 1080x1080 pixels).</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/login-canva-make-puzzle-feed.jpg"                      alt="login canva make puzzle feed"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2: Add Grids to your Custom Design on Canva</strong></p><p>This will simply open a new canvas on your interface so that you can add all kinds of elements. Now, go to the sidebar and under the Elements section, look for “Grids”. From here, you can add a 3x3 grid to get 9 equal images. If you want, you can make a grid and canvas of any other preferred size as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/add-grids-to-puzzle-feed.jpg"                      alt="add grids to puzzle feed"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3: Add Elements and Photos to your Grid</strong></p><p>Once the grid is created, you can just drag and drop all kinds of elements or pictures on it. At first, I would recommend adding photos so that you can easily place them and get their right placement on the canvas.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/add-elements-to-grid.jpg"                      alt="add elements to grid"                ></p><p>Following the same approach, you can find all kinds of elements on the sidebar that you can add to your grid. For instance, you can add headlines, texts, lines, vectors, and so much more.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/add-photo-to-grid.jpg"                      alt="add photo to grid"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4: Split and Post your Photos on Instagram</strong></p><p>That’s it! Once you have worked on the entire grid, you can go to the Export button and save the entire grid image on your system. Later, you can use any free solution (like Pine Tools) to split the grid into individual 1080x1080 photos for your Instagram feed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/split-grid-ig-puzzle.jpg"                      alt="split grid ig puzzle"                ></p><p>In this way, you can easily explore your creative side to make all kinds of puzzle feeds for Instagram via Canva.</p><h2 id="Part-5-Effective-Instagram-Puzzle-Feed-Ideas"><a href="#Part-5-Effective-Instagram-Puzzle-Feed-Ideas" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: Effective Instagram Puzzle Feed Ideas"></a>Part 5: Effective Instagram Puzzle Feed Ideas</h2><p>As you can see, it can be quite easy to come up with a puzzle feed for Instagram on Canva. To get even better results, you can consider implementing these Instagram puzzle feed ideas as well.</p><h4 id="Less-is-More"><a href="#Less-is-More" class="headerlink" title="Less is More"></a>Less is More</h4><p>A lot of people make the rookie mistake of adding too many design elements while creating an Instagram puzzle feed. Remember, your focus should be on your content and other elements are there to simply elevate the visual appeal of your feed.</p><h4 id="Be-Consistent"><a href="#Be-Consistent" class="headerlink" title="Be Consistent"></a>Be Consistent</h4><p>If you have just started with a puzzle theme on Instagram, then be consistent and stick to it for a while. For instance, if you would keep changing the overall theme after every 9 posts, then it will make your account look cluttered.</p><h4 id="Consider-your-account’s-theme"><a href="#Consider-your-account’s-theme" class="headerlink" title="Consider your account’s theme"></a>Consider your account’s theme</h4><p>Don’t go with any free or paid Instagram puzzle feed just because it looks appealing. You should consider the overall theme of your brand or personal account. The template should reflect the idea of your business. For instance, luxury brands can go with bold colors while fashion influencers can have some contrasting gradients on their template.</p><h3 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>I’m sure that after reading this guide, you would be able to pick the perfect puzzle feed for your Instagram account. As you can see, I have listed some readily available Instagram puzzle feed templates (free download) options.

It is a freely available online editor that offers tons of templates and options to create social media posts.</p><p>Here’s how you can also come up with a customizable puzzle feed for Instagram using Canva:</p><p><strong>Step 1: Choose to work on a custom design on Canva</strong></p><p>At first, you can just go to the official website of Canva, log in to your account, and choose to work on a Custom Design from its home. Here, you can enter the size as 3240x3240 pixels to work on a set of 3x3 images (since an ideal Instagram post is of 1080x1080 pixels).</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/login-canva-make-puzzle-feed.jpg"                      alt="login canva make puzzle feed"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2: Add Grids to your Custom Design on Canva</strong></p><p>This will simply open a new canvas on your interface so that you can add all kinds of elements. Now, go to the sidebar and under the Elements section, look for “Grids”. From here, you can add a 3x3 grid to get 9 equal images. If you want, you can make a grid and canvas of any other preferred size as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/add-grids-to-puzzle-feed.jpg"                      alt="add grids to puzzle feed"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3: Add Elements and Photos to your Grid</strong></p><p>Once the grid is created, you can just drag and drop all kinds of elements or pictures on it. At first, I would recommend adding photos so that you can easily place them and get their right placement on the canvas.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/add-elements-to-grid.jpg"                      alt="add elements to grid"                ></p><p>Following the same approach, you can find all kinds of elements on the sidebar that you can add to your grid. For instance, you can add headlines, texts, lines, vectors, and so much more.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/add-photo-to-grid.jpg"                      alt="add photo to grid"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4: Split and Post your Photos on Instagram</strong></p><p>That’s it! Once you have worked on the entire grid, you can go to the Export button and save the entire grid image on your system. Later, you can use any free solution (like Pine Tools) to split the grid into individual 1080x1080 photos for your Instagram feed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/split-grid-ig-puzzle.jpg"                      alt="split grid ig puzzle"                ></p><p>In this way, you can easily explore your creative side to make all kinds of puzzle feeds for Instagram via Canva.</p><h2 id="Part-5-Effective-Instagram-Puzzle-Feed-Ideas-1"><a href="#Part-5-Effective-Instagram-Puzzle-Feed-Ideas-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: Effective Instagram Puzzle Feed Ideas"></a>Part 5: Effective Instagram Puzzle Feed Ideas</h2><p>As you can see, it can be quite easy to come up with a puzzle feed for Instagram on Canva.

If you want, you can also come up with a puzzle feed on Instagram via Canva from scratch. It is a freely available online editor that offers tons of templates and options to create social media posts.</p><p>Here’s how you can also come up with a customizable puzzle feed for Instagram using Canva:</p><p><strong>Step 1: Choose to work on a custom design on Canva</strong></p><p>At first, you can just go to the official website of Canva, log in to your account, and choose to work on a Custom Design from its home. Here, you can enter the size as 3240x3240 pixels to work on a set of 3x3 images (since an ideal Instagram post is of 1080x1080 pixels).</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/login-canva-make-puzzle-feed.jpg"                      alt="login canva make puzzle feed"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2: Add Grids to your Custom Design on Canva</strong></p><p>This will simply open a new canvas on your interface so that you can add all kinds of elements. Now, go to the sidebar and under the Elements section, look for “Grids”. From here, you can add a 3x3 grid to get 9 equal images. If you want, you can make a grid and canvas of any other preferred size as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/add-grids-to-puzzle-feed.jpg"                      alt="add grids to puzzle feed"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3: Add Elements and Photos to your Grid</strong></p><p>Once the grid is created, you can just drag and drop all kinds of elements or pictures on it. At first, I would recommend adding photos so that you can easily place them and get their right placement on the canvas.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/add-elements-to-grid.jpg"                      alt="add elements to grid"                ></p><p>Following the same approach, you can find all kinds of elements on the sidebar that you can add to your grid. For instance, you can add headlines, texts, lines, vectors, and so much more.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/add-photo-to-grid.jpg"                      alt="add photo to grid"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4: Split and Post your Photos on Instagram</strong></p><p>That’s it! Once you have worked on the entire grid, you can go to the Export button and save the entire grid image on your system. Later, you can use any free solution (like Pine Tools) to split the grid into individual 1080x1080 photos for your Instagram feed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/split-grid-ig-puzzle.jpg"                      alt="split grid ig puzzle"                ></p><p>In this way, you can easily explore your creative side to make all kinds of puzzle feeds for Instagram via Canva.</p><h2 id="Part-5-Effective-Instagram-Puzzle-Feed-Ideas-3"><a href="#Part-5-Effective-Instagram-Puzzle-Feed-Ideas-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: Effective Instagram Puzzle Feed Ideas"></a>Part 5: Effective Instagram Puzzle Feed Ideas</h2><p>As you can see, it can be quite easy to come up with a puzzle feed for Instagram on Canva. To get even better results, you can consider implementing these Instagram puzzle feed ideas as well.</p><h4 id="Less-is-More-3"><a href="#Less-is-More-3" class="headerlink" title="Less is More"></a>Less is More</h4><p>A lot of people make the rookie mistake of adding too many design elements while creating an Instagram puzzle feed. Remember, your focus should be on your content and other elements are there to simply elevate the visual appeal of your feed.</p><h4 id="Be-Consistent-3"><a href="#Be-Consistent-3" class="headerlink" title="Be Consistent"></a>Be Consistent</h4><p>If you have just started with a puzzle theme on Instagram, then be consistent and stick to it for a while. For instance, if you would keep changing the overall theme after every 9 posts, then it will make your account look cluttered.</p><h4 id="Consider-your-account’s-theme-3"><a href="#Consider-your-account’s-theme-3" class="headerlink" title="Consider your account’s theme"></a>Consider your account’s theme</h4><p>Don’t go with any free or paid Instagram puzzle feed just because it looks appealing. You should consider the overall theme of your brand or personal account. The template should reflect the idea of your business. For instance, luxury brands can go with bold colors while fashion influencers can have some contrasting gradients on their template.</p><h3 id="Conclusion-3"><a href="#Conclusion-3" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>I’m sure that after reading this guide, you would be able to pick the perfect puzzle feed for your Instagram account. As you can see, I have listed some readily available Instagram puzzle feed templates (free download) options. Besides that, I have also provided a solution on how to create a puzzle feed for Instagram on Canva.

Only the most influential and popular Instagrammers are the lucky ones to achieve it. Verification process just signifies authentication and is not designed to show any kind of status.</p><p> Yet, people want their Instagram account to get verified. Validation is a great way to let people easily find your account from numerous impersonated accounts.</p><p> However, it is definitely not an easy task to get verified on Instagram. In this article learn how to get verified on Instagram and get the blue tick for growing followers.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1"><strong>Part1: What Does Official Instagram Say</strong></a></li><li><a href="#part2"><strong>Part2: Benefits Of Instagram Blue Tick</strong></a></li><li><a href="#part3"><strong>Part3: How Do You Get A Blue Check On Instagram</strong></a></li></ul><h2 id="Part-1-What-Does-Official-Instagram-Say"><a href="#Part-1-What-Does-Official-Instagram-Say" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Does Official Instagram Say?"></a>Part 1: What Does Official Instagram Say?</h2><p> Checking the <a class="link"   href="https://help.instagram.com/398038890351915" >help files <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> can give you the clear picture of the verification process of Instagram account.</p><p> The Instagram verified badge is the confirmation of the account being an authentic one. Whether a global brand, public figure or celebrity, a badge represents the genuineness of the account.</p><p> As the celebs and brands are the most followed ones and people would always like to find them instantanuously, Instagram ensures the community faces no issues while searching the right account of their most followed brands or celebs.</p><p> Instagram makes it very clear to the users that although Facebook owns Instagram, the two networking sites are not related to each other when it comes to followers or verifying the Instagram account.</p><p> According to Instagram policies, if you have several followers or if one can find you easily doesn’t qualify you for the Instagram blue tick. Only the accounts that are being copied or have high chances of being imitated or impersonated are the ones with the verified badges.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Benefits-Of-Instagram-Blue-Tick"><a href="#Part-2-Benefits-Of-Instagram-Blue-Tick" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Benefits Of Instagram Blue Tick"></a>Part 2: Benefits Of Instagram Blue Tick</h2><p> When you attain the Instagram blue tick, it means your account has been verified as authentic by the Instagram community. With this blue tick, you can easily find the brands and the public personalities you wish to follow without being misled by the imposters.</p><p> Beside your name in the account, there’s a small blue colored tick. People love to have this authenticity seal beside their name and it is in high demand. It is the reason why Instagram doesn’t verify every account, the strict verification process has led to keeping its value intact.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-Do-You-Get-A-Blue-Check-On-Instagram"><a href="#Part-3-How-Do-You-Get-A-Blue-Check-On-Instagram" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How Do You Get A Blue Check On Instagram?"></a>Part 3: How Do You Get A Blue Check On Instagram?</h2><h3 id="1-Build-Followers-And-Increase-Engagement"><a href="#1-Build-Followers-And-Increase-Engagement" class="headerlink" title="1. Build Followers And Increase Engagement"></a>1. Build Followers And Increase Engagement</h3><p> When you keep a check on your Instagram account, it helps to gain followers. Your account is at the top search results that build your account’s credibility. Whenever the question arises how to get verified on Instagram, several articles and write-ups inform that by building followers on the Instagram one can get easily verified.</p><p> This is a wrong notion and not completely correct. On the contrary, if you have lesser followers and more clones to your account, Instagram consider it as high priority account for verification and the Instagram blue tick follows. Huge followers are not everything when it comes to verifying the Instagram account.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ins-followers.JPG"                      alt="ins followers"                ></p><h3 id="2-Focus-Parallel-Promotion"><a href="#2-Focus-Parallel-Promotion" class="headerlink" title="2. Focus Parallel Promotion"></a>2. Focus Parallel Promotion</h3><p> Do you have other social media profiles like Twitter and Facebook? Linking your Instagram page with other social media profiles can make you Instagram verification easy.</p><p> For instance, share teaser photos from the Instagram album to your other profiles or drop in your Instagram profile link on the about me segment of other profiles. You may also post the link and ask or invite your friends to check the same.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/cross-promotion.JPG"                      alt="cross promotion"                ></p><h3 id="3-Post-At-The-Right-Time"><a href="#3-Post-At-The-Right-Time" class="headerlink" title="3.

Post At The Right Time</h3><p> Time of your posts is considered vital to attract the attention of your followers and retain them.</p><p> Which is the right time to post? A study reveals that 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. and 7 p.m. to 9 p.m. that is the lunch hours and late evening hours are the best time to post fresh content. These are the time spans when users are the most active and collect the most number of shares and likes.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ins-posting-time.JPG"                      alt="ins posting time"                ></p><h3 id="4-Put-Yourself-At-Risk-Of-Getting-Impersonated"><a href="#4-Put-Yourself-At-Risk-Of-Getting-Impersonated" class="headerlink" title="4. Put Yourself At Risk Of Getting Impersonated"></a>4. Put Yourself At Risk Of Getting Impersonated</h3><p> How to get verified on Instagram is a common question amongst the users and Instagram policies clearly defines that there shouldn’t be any stress over such questions. It is done to improve user experience and avert the imposters from creating fake accounts of public figures and misguide other users.</p><p> An Instagram blue tick implies that Instagram knows your identity and helps in building the users’ trust that they are not following any fake account of a public figure.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/impersonated.JPG"                      alt="impersonated"                ></p><h3 id="5-Choose-Right-Hashtags"><a href="#5-Choose-Right-Hashtags" class="headerlink" title="5. Choose Right Hashtags"></a>5. Choose Right Hashtags</h3><p> Choosing the perfect hashtags is one of the best ways to make yourself popular amongst your followers and other users. Instagram suggests many popular hastags or you may take help of hashtags suggesting apps for ideas.</p><p> It is vital to use the right hashtag that fits your niche.

Facebook, YouTube or Instagram TV all offer effective ways to advertise the products a company offers and ultimately boost its revenue streams. However, your posts on IGTV or any other social media platform may not be getting the kind of attention you were hoping for. If that’s the case, then you are at the right place because in this article we are going to show you how you can measure the performance of the videos you share on your IGTV channel.</p><h2 id="How-to-Measure-the-Performance-of-IGTV-Videos-1"><a href="#How-to-Measure-the-Performance-of-IGTV-Videos-1" class="headerlink" title="How to Measure the Performance of IGTV Videos?"></a>How to Measure the Performance of IGTV Videos?</h2><p> It has been less than a year since IGTV was launched, and it is already becoming obvious that this video sharing platform is here to stay. Such state of affairs presents a huge opportunity for anyone who wants to promote their products or services, as well as for video content creators who are looking for a new way to monetize their content.</p><p> Getting thousands of likes and comments on each and every post you share on IGTV is far from simple since you need to have the right type of content and a methodical approach to content promotion in order to be able to achieve this. IGTV also offers a few metrics that can help you gather the information you need to draw more attention to the videos you share on this platform.</p><h2 id="Which-Metrics-Are-The-Most-Important-For-IGTV-Video-Analysis"><a href="#Which-Metrics-Are-The-Most-Important-For-IGTV-Video-Analysis" class="headerlink" title="Which Metrics Are The Most Important For IGTV Video Analysis?"></a>Which Metrics Are The Most Important For IGTV Video Analysis?</h2><p> In this regard, IGTV is fairly similar to any other social network, since the metrics you’re going to need to track are identical to those on YouTube or Facebook. Analyzing the statistics of each of your videos can help you discover the time of day that is the most suitable for posting new content on your channel or what type of videos are the most popular. Here are the metrics that the IGTV platform provides to all of its users.</p><p><strong>Views –</strong> After someone spends more than three seconds watching your IGTV video, that post will get a view. The number of views a video gets indicates the total number of people who interacted with it, even for a period of time that is as brief as a couple of seconds.</p><p><strong>Engagements –</strong> This metric shows you the combined number of likes and comments a video has at any given moment.</p><p><strong>Audience Retention –</strong> A rather important statistic that tells you the percentage of all viewers who watched a video from start to finish.</p><p><strong>Audience Retention Graph –</strong> A visual representation of the percentage of all views a video has at any moment. You can use this graph to see the exact point in the video where people stop watching it, which enables you to improve the content you share on your IGTV channel.</p><p><strong>Engagement Rate –</strong> This option is only available if you’re using an Instagram analytics app, such as <a class="link"   href="https://delmondo.co/instagram-analytics/" >Delmondo <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that enables you to measure the engagement rate on each of your IGTV videos.</p><h2 id="How-and-Where-to-Check-the-Performance-of-IGTV-Videos"><a href="#How-and-Where-to-Check-the-Performance-of-IGTV-Videos" class="headerlink" title="How and Where to Check the Performance of IGTV Videos?"></a>How and Where to Check the Performance of IGTV Videos?</h2><p> Accessing the IGTV analytics is a quick and simple process since you just have to open a video and tap on the <strong>three-dot icon</strong>, located next to <strong>Like, Comment and Share buttons</strong>. Once the menu appears on the screen, you just have to select the <strong>View Insights option</strong> and a new window will load on the screen showing you the number of <strong>Views, Likes and Comments</strong> that particular video has at the moment.</p><p> The <strong>Audience Retention Graph</strong> is located directly below these statistics, and you can use it at any moment to see <strong>the percentage of viewers</strong> who watched the entire video. These metrics can help you discover the type of content that can attract a large audience on IGTV. It is worth noting that these metrics are only available for IGTV videos, so if you’re also using Instagram and Instagram Stories you might want to consider installing an Instagram analytics app that enables you to conduct a more thorough analysis of the metrics the content you’re sharing is generating.</p><h2 id="How-to-Promote-IGTV-Videos-and-Get-More-Views"><a href="#How-to-Promote-IGTV-Videos-and-Get-More-Views" class="headerlink" title="How to Promote IGTV Videos and Get More Views?"></a>How to Promote IGTV Videos and Get More Views?</h2><p> Focusing on a single social network during an online marketing campaign isn’t necessarily a good choice, since sharing a video on multiple platforms can improve its visibility significantly. That’s why you should share your IGTV videos on Twitter, Facebook and all other popular online destinations that grant you access to a large audience. What’s more, you can also <strong>create a blog post that includes additional information about the topic</strong> a video is covering. If you scripted your IGTV video, then you can simply copy <strong>that script into a blog post and then just embed that IGTV video into the blog post</strong>. Alternatively, you can write a short description of the video that helps potential viewers get a better idea of what the video is about.</p><p> Each time you upload a new video to your IGTV channel you can use Instagram stories and Instagram live to promote your new post. The <strong>IGTV’s algorithm is relatively young and it still has a lot of room for improvement</strong>, which is why you have to use all means available to you that allow you to increase the number of views and likes your content is getting.</p><h2 id="Can-You-See-Who-Who-Watched-Your-IGTV-Videos"><a href="#Can-You-See-Who-Who-Watched-Your-IGTV-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Can You See Who Who Watched Your IGTV Videos?"></a>Can You See Who Who Watched Your IGTV Videos?</h2><p> The shortest answer to this question is no. You can never know who watched your videos, just as other IGTV users can’t ever know that you watched a video they shared on their channel. As we already explained you can check how many people watched your video, but you can’t know who they are unless they also liked your video. Don’t trust the people who claim that they can help you find out who watched your videos, because they can’t.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p> Online marketing isn’t an exact science, but that doesn’t mean that you should disregard the statistics and the metrics provided by either IGTV or any other app designed to track the performance of your posts on social media.

You can use this graph to see the exact point in the video where people stop watching it, which enables you to improve the content you share on your IGTV channel.</p><p><strong>Engagement Rate –</strong> This option is only available if you’re using an Instagram analytics app, such as <a class="link"   href="https://delmondo.co/instagram-analytics/" >Delmondo <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that enables you to measure the engagement rate on each of your IGTV videos.</p><h2 id="How-and-Where-to-Check-the-Performance-of-IGTV-Videos-2"><a href="#How-and-Where-to-Check-the-Performance-of-IGTV-Videos-2" class="headerlink" title="How and Where to Check the Performance of IGTV Videos?"></a>How and Where to Check the Performance of IGTV Videos?</h2><p> Accessing the IGTV analytics is a quick and simple process since you just have to open a video and tap on the <strong>three-dot icon</strong>, located next to <strong>Like, Comment and Share buttons</strong>. Once the menu appears on the screen, you just have to select the <strong>View Insights option</strong> and a new window will load on the screen showing you the number of <strong>Views, Likes and Comments</strong> that particular video has at the moment.</p><p> The <strong>Audience Retention Graph</strong> is located directly below these statistics, and you can use it at any moment to see <strong>the percentage of viewers</strong> who watched the entire video. These metrics can help you discover the type of content that can attract a large audience on IGTV. It is worth noting that these metrics are only available for IGTV videos, so if you’re also using Instagram and Instagram Stories you might want to consider installing an Instagram analytics app that enables you to conduct a more thorough analysis of the metrics the content you’re sharing is generating.</p><h2 id="How-to-Promote-IGTV-Videos-and-Get-More-Views-2"><a href="#How-to-Promote-IGTV-Videos-and-Get-More-Views-2" class="headerlink" title="How to Promote IGTV Videos and Get More Views?"></a>How to Promote IGTV Videos and Get More Views?</h2><p> Focusing on a single social network during an online marketing campaign isn’t necessarily a good choice, since sharing a video on multiple platforms can improve its visibility significantly. That’s why you should share your IGTV videos on Twitter, Facebook and all other popular online destinations that grant you access to a large audience. What’s more, you can also <strong>create a blog post that includes additional information about the topic</strong> a video is covering. If you scripted your IGTV video, then you can simply copy <strong>that script into a blog post and then just embed that IGTV video into the blog post</strong>. Alternatively, you can write a short description of the video that helps potential viewers get a better idea of what the video is about.</p><p> Each time you upload a new video to your IGTV channel you can use Instagram stories and Instagram live to promote your new post. The <strong>IGTV’s algorithm is relatively young and it still has a lot of room for improvement</strong>, which is why you have to use all means available to you that allow you to increase the number of views and likes your content is getting.</p><h2 id="Can-You-See-Who-Who-Watched-Your-IGTV-Videos-2"><a href="#Can-You-See-Who-Who-Watched-Your-IGTV-Videos-2" class="headerlink" title="Can You See Who Who Watched Your IGTV Videos?"></a>Can You See Who Who Watched Your IGTV Videos?</h2><p> The shortest answer to this question is no. You can never know who watched your videos, just as other IGTV users can’t ever know that you watched a video they shared on their channel. As we already explained you can check how many people watched your video, but you can’t know who they are unless they also liked your video. Don’t trust the people who claim that they can help you find out who watched your videos, because they can’t.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p> Online marketing isn’t an exact science, but that doesn’t mean that you should disregard the statistics and the metrics provided by either IGTV or any other app designed to track the performance of your posts on social media.

Facebook, YouTube or Instagram TV all offer effective ways to advertise the products a company offers and ultimately boost its revenue streams. However, your posts on IGTV or any other social media platform may not be getting the kind of attention you were hoping for. If that’s the case, then you are at the right place because in this article we are going to show you how you can measure the performance of the videos you share on your IGTV channel.</p><h2 id="How-to-Measure-the-Performance-of-IGTV-Videos-4"><a href="#How-to-Measure-the-Performance-of-IGTV-Videos-4" class="headerlink" title="How to Measure the Performance of IGTV Videos?"></a>How to Measure the Performance of IGTV Videos?</h2><p> It has been less than a year since IGTV was launched, and it is already becoming obvious that this video sharing platform is here to stay. Such state of affairs presents a huge opportunity for anyone who wants to promote their products or services, as well as for video content creators who are looking for a new way to monetize their content.</p><p> Getting thousands of likes and comments on each and every post you share on IGTV is far from simple since you need to have the right type of content and a methodical approach to content promotion in order to be able to achieve this. IGTV also offers a few metrics that can help you gather the information you need to draw more attention to the videos you share on this platform.</p><h2 id="Which-Metrics-Are-The-Most-Important-For-IGTV-Video-Analysis-3"><a href="#Which-Metrics-Are-The-Most-Important-For-IGTV-Video-Analysis-3" class="headerlink" title="Which Metrics Are The Most Important For IGTV Video Analysis?"></a>Which Metrics Are The Most Important For IGTV Video Analysis?</h2><p> In this regard, IGTV is fairly similar to any other social network, since the metrics you’re going to need to track are identical to those on YouTube or Facebook. Analyzing the statistics of each of your videos can help you discover the time of day that is the most suitable for posting new content on your channel or what type of videos are the most popular. Here are the metrics that the IGTV platform provides to all of its users.</p><p><strong>Views –</strong> After someone spends more than three seconds watching your IGTV video, that post will get a view.

Let’s take a quick look!</p><p>InstagramSave, as the name itself suggests, is a free, yes you read it right, 100% free converter. It is available worldwide and requires no installation. All you need is an internet connection, and you’re good to go. Are you excited yet? But hold your horses, because these aren’t the only perks that InstagramSave offers.

CHOOSE VIDEO: Open the video that you are crushing over and wish to download to be watched repeatedly and that too in excellent resolution.</p><p>2. COPY URL: Tap the three dots on the top right corner of the desired video and click on ‘Copy Link,’ which is the URL in the boring tech language, so don’t confuse yourself and follow my lead.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/copy-instagram-video-link1.jpg"                      alt="copy instagram video link"                ></p><p>3.

Click on ‘New Project’ and then tap ‘Files,’ select ‘Import Media’ from the dropdown menu, and then ‘Import Media Files’ to add the selected video to your library.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/import-instagram-video-to-filmora1.jpg"                      alt="import new video file"                ></p><p>3. Drag and drop the video onto the timeline (Don’t change the resolution if a dialogue box pops up). Then click on ‘File’ again and select ‘Project Settings’. Choose the resolution of 1080×1080 or 1:1 square, the optimum resolution for your Instagram video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/fit-instagram-aspect-ratio2.jpg"                      alt="change to instagram mode"                ></p><p>4. Go to ‘Media, select ‘Sample Colors’, and choose your liking color to introduce the cinematic effect by adding colored bars above and below the video. Then you can scale up or down the video size in the preview window directly.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-background-to-instagram-video3.jpg"                      alt="add white color background"                ></p><p>5. To get the viewer’s attention, you can add texts for maximum effect. Click ‘Titles’ and drag and drop a specific text style onto the third track.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-titles-to-instagram-video4.jpg"                      alt="go to titles tab"                ></p><p>6. Double click the title on the track, tap <strong>ADVANCED</strong>, choose a text style, change the font color, and apply an animation to the text as you like.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/edit-and-customize-text5.jpg"                      alt="apply animation to text"                ></p><p><strong>Note:</strong> In the ‘Audio’ tab, you can import your own music and add it to the video. And double click the audio you add, you will be able to fade in, fade out and denoise the audio.</p><p>7. Press ‘Export’ and choose the device you wish to save the video on. You can upload the exported video to Instagram once you finish the export process.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/create-tinder-loop-export-video.jpg"                      alt="export instagram video"                ></p><h2 id="CONCLUSION"><a href="#CONCLUSION" class="headerlink" title="CONCLUSION"></a>CONCLUSION</h2><p>The bottom line is that we discussed the two main methods of converting your favorite Instagram videos to MP4. It doesn’t matter whether you have an internet connection or not. You will be able to convert either way. Both offline and online Instagram to MP4 converter is very efficient. Still, in my personal opinion, Wondershare Uniconverter takes the lead due to its additional advanced editing tools.</p><p>Another essential media creator, namely Filmora, is not to be ignored while making videos. Filmora has proved to be the best and easiest video creator and editor requiring no expertise.

It is a great place to share your photos and videos to build your social networking. And when you are connected daily to your new fans on Instagram, music adding-on is an integral part of it. Appropriate music can convey your feelings or mobilize the audience’s emotions.</p><p>However, you must understand its music copyright rules before sharing your tunes.</p><p>This article will give you a comprehensive guide to understanding Instagram’s rules about copyright music. We’ll also discuss a few tips for staying compliant and avoiding any potential copyright issues.</p><h2 id="How-Does-Instagram-Detect-Copyright-Music"><a href="#How-Does-Instagram-Detect-Copyright-Music" class="headerlink" title="How Does Instagram Detect Copyright Music?"></a>How Does Instagram Detect Copyright Music?</h2><p>Firstly, let’s look into the background of Instagram’s working mechanism for copyright music detection.</p><p>Instagram has an automated system that generally detects copyrighted content in user posts, live shows, or IGTV. Even though the procedure is automated, mistakes can still occur; however, this wouldn’t stop the platform from taking down posts or videos entirely from user profiles.</p><p>Instagram’s recently improved copyright infringement detection system now detects copyrighted music in content. The service sends a pop-up notification to the users, which gives them time to either stop using the track or change it in their posts.</p><p>If the system detects copyrighted content, here’s what happens to your Instagram account:</p><ul><li>Your post may be muted on Instagram.</li><li>Instagram notifies you to take the track down if you’re broadcasting a track during a Livestream.</li><li>Instagram may take down your post entirely.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/instagram-copyright-notification.png"                      alt="instagram copyright notification"                ></p><h2 id="Instagram-Music-Copyright-Rules"><a href="#Instagram-Music-Copyright-Rules" class="headerlink" title="Instagram Music Copyright Rules"></a>Instagram Music Copyright Rules</h2><p>After knowing how Instagram detects copyrighted music and the results of being involved with music copyright issues, you may wonder how to avoid the risks.</p><p>Below are the three general copyright principles you should keep in mind when using music on Instagram:</p><ul><li><strong>Apply A Video When Sharing Music:</strong> Instagram allows you to share a recording of an artist or band performing live and applying music to a short video.</li><li><strong>Keep The Video Short:</strong> Make sure your video is short. Instagram’s detection system will limit your content if you post a more extended clip with copyrighted music.</li><li><strong>Unlimited Music For Your Instagram Stories:</strong> If you share a story on Instagram, the platform allows you to add unlimited copyrighted music from its built-in music library.</li></ul><h2 id="How-To-Use-Copyright-Music-On-Instagram"><a href="#How-To-Use-Copyright-Music-On-Instagram" class="headerlink" title="How To Use Copyright Music On Instagram"></a>How To Use Copyright Music On Instagram</h2><p>Under Instagram’s automated detection system and copyright music rules, using copyrighted music is very important to ensure everything is right for your Instagram content.</p><p>In this part, we will focus on using royalty-free music on Instagram. We have prepared three aspects about its usage of it to provide overall guidance for you.</p><h3 id="1-Workarounds-for-Using-Copyrighted-Music-on-Instagram"><a href="#1-Workarounds-for-Using-Copyrighted-Music-on-Instagram" class="headerlink" title="(1) Workarounds for Using Copyrighted Music on Instagram"></a>(1) Workarounds for Using Copyrighted Music on Instagram</h3><p>There are several workarounds for using <strong>copyrighted music on Instagram:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Collaborating With Artists Or Musicians:</strong> Reach out to local musicians or new artists to see if you can collaborate and create custom sounds for your Instagram videos. Not only will you have copyright-free music that you can use, but you will also support independent artists!</li><li><strong>Asking For Permission:</strong> To avoid copyright issues on Instagram, you can contact the creator to seek permission before using their content.</li><li><strong>Pay For The Copyrighted Music:</strong> You can opt to pay for royalty-free music on your IG posts, live streams, or IGTV from various online libraries, such as <a class="link"   href="https://pixabay.com/" >Pixaby, <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://soundcloud.com/" >SoundCloud <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, and <a class="link"   href="https://www.apple.com/apple-music/" >Apple Music <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</li><li><strong>Give Credit In Your Caption:</strong> To use copyrighted music on your IG content, give credit to the original creator in your post’s caption.</li><li><strong>Post Instagram Reel Videos:</strong> Reels are short videos of about 15 seconds with a built-in music feature that applies a sticker to your content with the song’s details and can save you from Instagram copyright music issues.</li></ul><h3 id="2-A-Video-Editor-To-Avoid-Copyright-Issue-And-Post-Your-Videos-On-Instagram"><a href="#2-A-Video-Editor-To-Avoid-Copyright-Issue-And-Post-Your-Videos-On-Instagram" class="headerlink" title="(2) A Video Editor To Avoid Copyright Issue And Post Your Videos On Instagram"></a>(2) A Video Editor To Avoid Copyright Issue And Post Your Videos On Instagram</h3><p>Copyright can be a tricky thing, especially when it comes to posting music videos on Instagram.

Celebrities and businesses earn great fortune through high-quality marketing videos. To join the <strong><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >profitable video marketing era <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong>, you can create your own IGTV marketing videos now<img src="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" alt="![create marketing videos](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/create-marketing-videos.png)"></p><h2 id="How-to-Upload-Videos-to-IGTV-4"><a href="#How-to-Upload-Videos-to-IGTV-4" class="headerlink" title="How to Upload Videos to IGTV?"></a>How to Upload Videos to IGTV?</h2><p>The process of uploading a video to IGTV isn’t much more complicated than posting a photo or video to your Instagram account and it can be completed in just a couple of quick taps. Naturally, in order to be able to use IGTV, you must have an Instagram account, so before you take any other steps, make sure that you are signed in to your account on Instagram.</p><h4 id="Creating-an-IGTV-Channel-3"><a href="#Creating-an-IGTV-Channel-3" class="headerlink" title="Creating an IGTV Channel"></a>Creating an IGTV Channel</h4><p>Launch the Instagram app, and then tap on the <strong>Settings icon</strong> located in the upper right corner. Pick the <strong>Create Channel</strong> option and that is it, you will now be able to add videos to your IGTV channel or browse and watch videos other creators post on their channels.</p><h4 id="Uploading-Videos-to-IGTV-Using-the-Instagram-or-the-IGTV-app-3"><a href="#Uploading-Videos-to-IGTV-Using-the-Instagram-or-the-IGTV-app-3" class="headerlink" title="Uploading Videos to IGTV Using the Instagram or the IGTV app"></a>Uploading Videos to IGTV Using the Instagram or the IGTV app</h4><p>It doesn’t really matter which of these two apps you decide to use to upload videos to your IGTV channel, because the process is identical. Simply tap on the <strong>IGTV icon</strong> that looks like, well, a TV with an antenna and then tap on the <strong>+ icon</strong> to add a video from your camera roll. Keep in mind that videos that last more than a couple of minutes can be huge in size and that it might be better to upload videos to your IGTV channel from a computer if the video is larger than one or two gigabytes.</p><p>Write a description of the video and give it a catchy title before hitting the <strong>Post button</strong>. Optionally, you can <strong>enable the share to Facebook option</strong> even before you post the video to your IGTV channel, but you can also share a video to different social media platforms after you posted it to IGTV.</p><h4 id="Uploading-Videos-to-IGTV-from-a-Computer-3"><a href="#Uploading-Videos-to-IGTV-from-a-Computer-3" class="headerlink" title="Uploading Videos to IGTV from a Computer"></a>Uploading Videos to IGTV from a Computer</h4><p>Open your web browser and head over to <strong>instagram.com.</strong> If you’re not already signed in, you’ll be asked to provide the <strong>login information</strong>, so once you’ve inserted your <strong>username and password</strong> you’ll be able to see your Instagram feed. Click on the icon located next to the heart-shaped icon that displays all the notifications, located in the top right corner, in order to gain access to your Instagram channel.</p><p>Proceed to click on the <strong>IGTV icon</strong>, and then click on the <strong>Upload button</strong>. Once a new page loads you can <strong>upload a cover photo</strong> or add a <strong>description and a title</strong>. On the left side of the screen you will be able to see a <strong>+ icon</strong> and below it, you’ll see the <strong>Drag and Drop a Video File</strong> message. You can either <strong>drag and drop</strong> a video file from a folder to the designated area of the screen or you can click on the <strong>+ icon</strong> and navigate to the folder in which the file you want to upload is located. If you would like to <strong>share the video on Facebook and IGTV at the same time</strong>, you must first <strong>connect your IGTV to your Facebook page</strong>. Afterward, you should simply <strong>click on the IGTV and Facebook page option</strong> to enable it and proceed to click on the Post button and the bottom of the screen.</p><h4 id="Video-Upload-Requirements-for-IGTV-3"><a href="#Video-Upload-Requirements-for-IGTV-3" class="headerlink" title="Video Upload Requirements for IGTV"></a>Video Upload Requirements for IGTV</h4><p>Even though IGTV videos can last up to <strong>sixty minutes</strong>, this option is <strong>reserved for verified accounts.</strong> Regular IGTV creators can only upload videos that <strong>last from fifteen seconds up to ten minutes.</strong> In addition, you can only upload <strong>MP4 video</strong> files to your IGTV channel, since the platform <strong>doesn’t support any other video file format</strong> at the moment.</p><p>Currently, the size of a video can’t exceed <strong>560 MB</strong> for videos between <strong>15 seconds and ten minutes,</strong> while the maximum file size for a sixty-minute videos is limited to <strong>3.6 GB</strong>. IGTV videos have to be vertical, and the content you upload must have a minimum <strong>4:5 aspect ratio, while the maximum aspect ratio is 9:16.</strong></p><h2 id="Tips-for-Uploading-and-Posting-Videos-to-IGTV-3"><a href="#Tips-for-Uploading-and-Posting-Videos-to-IGTV-3" class="headerlink" title="Tips for Uploading and Posting Videos to IGTV"></a>Tips for Uploading and Posting Videos to IGTV</h2><p>Despite the fact that you can now upload videos that last for an entire hour, it is still better to keep the content you share on your IGTV channel short. Videos that <strong>last between two and five minutes</strong> are best suited for the audience on social media. Posting videos that surpass the five-minute limit can prove to be counterproductive because people won’t take the time to watch them from start to finish.</p><p>Aside from YouTube, a majority of videos on social media platforms are watched without sound. That’s why adding subtitles to your video may be a good idea, but just remember that you have to hardcode the subtitles into the video since SRT files don’t work well with vertical videos.</p><h2 id="Analyzing-and-Promoting-an-IGTV-Channel-3"><a href="#Analyzing-and-Promoting-an-IGTV-Channel-3" class="headerlink" title="Analyzing and Promoting an IGTV Channel"></a>Analyzing and Promoting an IGTV Channel</h2><p>After uploading a video to IGTV you can monitor the number of <strong>likes, comments, and views</strong> by tapping on the <strong>‘three dots’ icon</strong> located next to the <strong>Like, Comment and Share icons</strong> on a particular video. A <strong>drop-down menu will appear</strong> on the screen and you should tap on the <strong>View Insights</strong> option in order to see how many <strong>views, likes and comments</strong> your video got. Below the <strong>Engagement information</strong>, you can find the <strong>Audience Retention</strong> menu that offers <strong>Average Percentage Watch</strong> information as well as <strong>a drop-off graph</strong> that tells you at which point viewers stop watching your video. The data provided by the IGTV analytics can be extremely valuable when planning future posts on IGTV. Moreover, you can use conventional tools for content promotion on Instagram to increase the number of views your IGTV videos are getting.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>In the first six months after its initial launch IGTV seems like it has made Instagram more entertaining because it encourages creators to post captivating videos people around the globe love watching.

So, while marketing a product on Instagram, you must know and understand the culture followed at Instagram.</p><p> For instance, when the brand <a class="link"   href="https://www.daytranslations.com/blog/how-pepsi-expands/" >Pepsi selected China to expand <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, the launch slogan was “Pepsi Brings You Back to Life” which was misinterpreted by the people as “Pepsi Brings Your Ancestors Back from the Grave”. This was a huge mistake for the brand when it was trying to make a mark on the global level.</p><p> So, prior to planning strategies for Instagram video marketing, you must be aware of the type of promotions and marketing you should plan so that you never go wrong with your strategies. You must know the audience and understand their choices, likes, and what can drive them to your video.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Plan-Your-Instagram-Video-Marketing"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Plan-Your-Instagram-Video-Marketing" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Plan Your Instagram Video Marketing"></a>Part 2: How to Plan Your Instagram Video Marketing</h2><h3 id="Step-1-Know-Your-Objective"><a href="#Step-1-Know-Your-Objective" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Know Your Objective"></a>Step 1: Know Your Objective</h3><p> To ensure a successful Instagram video marketing strategy, it is important that your videos are not just moving pieces without any message to convey. There has to be some <a class="link"   href="https://animoto.com/blog/business/video-marketing-objectives" >key objective for your Instagram video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p> However, every video may not have a thoughtful or reflective objective because product launches or major announcements and not done each and every week. Whatever the objective of your video is, the moving images must tell a story that the audiences can accept and turn to again and again.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/IG-goal.jpg"                      alt="Instagram Video Marketing goals"                ></p><h3 id="Step-2-Keep-Your-Video-Short"><a href="#Step-2-Keep-Your-Video-Short" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Keep Your Video Short"></a>Step 2: Keep Your Video Short</h3><p> A singular post on Instagram can have up to a 60 minutes long video but, you must keep it <a class="link"   href="https://www.socialmediaexaminer.com/creating-short-snackable-videos-instagram-lindsay-ostrom/" >crisp, interesting, sweet, and short <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. No matter what the video length is, you must ensure that the video must be able to deliver the strong message that it intends to. The primary objective of the video must be to come across clearly without confusing the viewers.</p><p> It is quite possible that your Instagram video marketing content is for introducing a new product. The product can be in a number of colors or have a lot of features. But, that doesn’t mean you have to include it all in a 60-second video. Only add a few features and make the objective of the video clear for the audience to feel connected.</p><p> You may also create several short videos to make the audience understand it easily instead of one long video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/short-video.JPG"                      alt="Instagram Video Marketing short video"                ></p><h3 id="Step-3-Make-High-Quality-Video"><a href="#Step-3-Make-High-Quality-Video" class="headerlink" title="Step 3: Make High-Quality Video"></a>Step 3: Make High-Quality Video</h3><p> You must never compromise on the quality of the video when it comes to <a class="link"   href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/05/04/instagram-videos" >how to make Instagram video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

What do you want the users to do once the video is over? The call to action helps in conversion. It is not really necessary for you to add a call to action button within the video but when your video has got attention from the viewers, the next step automatically becomes a clear call to action for the viewers.</p><p> If you wish to increase your Brand’s Insta following, make sure your call to action for the users must be “follow the Instagram page for more updates. If you want the users to share the video, you must ask the user to tag a like-minded friend.

It is not only fun to create but also adds movement to your Instagram grid.</p><p> When you have no time to post or no ready content, <a class="link"   href="https://help.instagram.com/boomerang/1028997297162413" >making a boomerang videos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> can be a great option to boost your views while still maintaining the superior content that you consistently share.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/Boomerang-ig.jpg"                      alt="Instagram video ideas Boomerang"                ></p><h3 id="5-Live-Streaming-An-Event-3"><a href="#5-Live-Streaming-An-Event-3" class="headerlink" title="5. Live Streaming An Event"></a>5. Live Streaming An Event</h3><p> When you plan to promote an event, it is important to start it in advance when you have lots of time to plan and focus on it. Creating some of the events focused videos with great captions can be a great way to make an acoustic relation with the prospective visitors in the event and show them what exactly they can expect from you.</p><p> Just posts and images are not enough to promote your event. Live streaming an event can make a larger impact. Your viewers must know that the event cannot be missed out in anyway.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ins-live-iphone.JPG"                      alt="Instagram video ideas Live Streaming"                ></p><h3 id="6-Video-Slideshow-3"><a href="#6-Video-Slideshow-3" class="headerlink" title="6.

If you are apprehensive about creating a video, you may just pick a few images and get your way through PowerPoint and make a slideshow.</p><p> The slideshows help in creating list, countdowns, steps, or to show transformation or progress. For instance, the Chevy Trucks video is a great example of slideshows. It has no effects or texts, yet the brand story is reflected through a powerful story.</p><p> If you have any such transformation stories, you may use the journey images to add an emotional story. It can be one of the best Instagram video ideas amongst all.</p><h3 id="7-Q-A-Video-3"><a href="#7-Q-A-Video-3" class="headerlink" title="7. Q&amp;A Video"></a>7.

Let’s get started.</p><h4 id="1-What-are-Instagram-hashtags-and-how-do-they-work"><a href="#1-What-are-Instagram-hashtags-and-how-do-they-work" class="headerlink" title="1.  What are Instagram hashtags and how do they work?"></a>1.  What are Instagram hashtags and how do they work?</h4><p>Before we can start on how to hashtag on Instagram, it’s important that we’re all on the same page in terms of what they are and how they work.</p><p>In a nutshell, an Instagram hashtag is a bookmark; a way of categorizing content. It can be any word, phrase, number or even emoji which is prefixed by the hash symbol (#). Clicking on a hashtag on Instagram will bring up all the posts that have used that hashtag, so that you can discover new content you are interested in.</p><h4 id="2-Why-should-you-use-hashtags"><a href="#2-Why-should-you-use-hashtags" class="headerlink" title="2.  Why should you use hashtags?"></a>2.  Why should you use hashtags?</h4><p>Whether you’re a startup, new to Instagram or simply haven’t managed to acquire many followers, using hashtags on Instagram is a great way to grow your audience. By finding out how to hashtag on Instagram, your posts can be found by a much larger circle of users.</p><p>As a business, using hashtags on Instagram will help you be discovered by people who don’t already follow your page, helping you acquire new followers and boosting brand recognition. Not only that, but when you know how to use hashtags on Instagram, you can increase your reach on other channels too, because when a user shares your content to Twitter or Facebook, the hashtag is shared with it.</p><h4 id="3-What-types-of-hashtags-are-there"><a href="#3-What-types-of-hashtags-are-there" class="headerlink" title="3.  What types of hashtags are there?"></a>3.  What types of hashtags are there?</h4><p>When deciding how to use hashtags on Instagram, it’s important to recognize the various types of hashtags so that you can pick the right ones for you. The right hashtags will depend on your goals as a business, as well as the type of content you are sharing at that time. For example:</p><ul><li><strong>Product, service and general hashtags:</strong> These might be what you do as a business (e.g. #painter) or what product you sell (e.g. #furniture). They are good for brands who want to make their work or products better known but can be difficult to achieve engagement for as there tends to be high competition.</li><li>**Niche hashtags:**For more chance of being seen, niche hashtags reduce the competition by being more specific about your product or service. For example, #ladiesshoes rather than just #shoes will be found by more people specifically interested in shoes, while #ladiesheels will reach an even more interested audience.</li><li><strong>Interest hashtags:</strong> To reach enthusiasts in your niche, use interest related hashtags that describe your post. Research popular tags from the top posts section or see what specific groups are using to tag their posts. For instance, #shoeaholics or #heelsofInstagram will engage with those passionate about amazing footwear.</li><li><strong>Location hashtags:</strong> As you might have guessed, these tags are specifically the places where the content was show, for example #UK, #london or #hammersmith will find users who are interested in products, services or images from that location. You could also combine these with your service to narrow the audience even further, for instance #heelsinlondon or #londonfashionblogger.</li><li><strong>Branded hashtags:</strong> These types of hashtags are often used by businesses on Instagram to promote their brand or a particular ad campaign. You might promote the name of your business, e.g. #divashoes, or a slogan you are pushing, such as #comfortfit. However, be aware these don’t tend to get more followers on their own, because people won’t be searching for or adding branded hashtags to their posts unless they are compelled to do so. However, they can be great for engagement during a live event, for creating contests and to position your brand deeper in your audience’s mind, so use them where you can.</li></ul><p>Understanding these different types of hashtags will help you understand how to use hashtags on Instagram better, by lacing your post with a variety of suitable tags.</p><h4 id="4-How-to-add-a-hashtag-to-your-post"><a href="#4-How-to-add-a-hashtag-to-your-post" class="headerlink" title="4.  How to add a hashtag to your post"></a>4.  How to add a hashtag to your post</h4><p>If you’re not sure how to hashtag on Instagram, here’s a quick walkthrough. You can add tags as either captions to your post or in the comments area. As long as your account is public, the hashtag will ensure your post is discoverable via the corresponding hashtag page. Here’s how it works:</p><ul><li>Upload a photo or video to your Instagram account</li><li>Pick your filters and edit as required</li><li>Type the hash (#) symbol in the caption field followed by the text you want to be indexed for</li><li>Tap OK</li><li>Then share</li></ul><p>If you prefer to add your hashtag to the comments section, just find the post and type in your hashtag in the comments section. This is particularly good if you plan to use a lot of hashtags and don’t want to make your post look too messy.</p><p>Letters, numbers and emojis work as hashtags, but special characters and spaces do not. Don’t add in any symbols like * or %, and type words altogether without any spaces. You cannot add hashtags to other people’s posts, only your own, and can use up to 30 tags on any single post.</p><h4 id="5-How-to-find-the-best-hashtags-for-your-brand"><a href="#5-How-to-find-the-best-hashtags-for-your-brand" class="headerlink" title="5.  How to find the best hashtags for your brand"></a>5.  How to find the best hashtags for your brand</h4><p>If you’re not sure how to find the best hashtags for Instagram, there are a few options open to you:</p><ul><li><strong>Search:</strong> Just doing a simple search can throw up some interesting hashtags and useful data for your post. Click in the search bar and begin your query with a #. Instagram will present you with a list of suggestions as you start to type, as well as how many posts have been tagged with that particular hashtag. If you don’t know where to start, think about what your business does, provides or specializes in as a good launchpad. If you already have a list of keywords you use for SEO or PPC, this can be a great source of initial inspiration.</li><li><strong>Competition:</strong> If there are other businesses already on Instagram who are in your niche, maybe who have a sizeable following already, they may well already be leveraging a hashtag strategy which you can learn from. Visit their account and see which hashtags they use on a regular basis. If they’re posting the same tags over and over again, there’s a good chance they’ve already done a bit of trial and error research and have discovered the ones that work.</li><li><strong>Related:</strong> If you’ve got a hashtag or two already that you get good engagement from, visit the pages for those hashtags and see what else is posted alongside them. There may be other hashtag trends relating to your business that you haven’t thought of yet, and could try including in future posts.</li><li><strong>Influencers:</strong> Who are the biggest influencers in your industry? Is there a blogger who simply loves products like yours? If so, check out what hashtags they use, and follow along with their favorites to reach the people who follow them. Their audience is essentially the same as yours, so why not learn from the experts?</li></ul><p>Avoid using ‘spammy’ hashtags such as #like4like, #followme, #follow4follow and #followback. These are insanely popular among low quality Instagramers who simply want more followers, without caring about the quality. Stick to carefully chosen, related hashtags to gain valuable followers for your business.</p><h4 id="6-How-many-hashtags-should-you-use"><a href="#6-How-many-hashtags-should-you-use" class="headerlink" title="6.  How many hashtags should you use?"></a>6.  How many hashtags should you use?</h4><p>No doubt you’ve uncovered a great list of potential hashtags for your Instagram posts, but how many should you use in each posting? Instagram is less strict than Twitter, in that you can use up to 30 hashtags per post. However, that doesn’t mean you should go all out on every post, so how many is enough?</p><p>For some insight into the ‘norm’, you can take a look at influencers and competitors and see how many hashtags they tend to use. You can also conduct a bit of trial and error testing to see how to use hashtags on Instagram to their full effect, by varying the number you use and tracking the results.</p><p>Research conducted last year found that there is certainly a case for the more the merrier. Buffer discovered that engagement was greatest on posts with 11 hashtags, at 79.5 per cent compared to just 29 per cent for one. A separate study by TrackMaven found that nine hashtags performed best.</p><p>As a general rule, there is no rule. Optimum hashtag numbers will depend on your industry, but there’s no need to be stingy as more definitely is more. Remember to test and adapt to the response you are getting to make hashtags work for your brand.</p><h4 id="7-How-to-get-onto-Top-Posts"><a href="#7-How-to-get-onto-Top-Posts" class="headerlink" title="7.  How to get onto Top Posts"></a>7.  How to get onto Top Posts</h4><p>Getting bumped up to a Top Post is the holy grail of how to hashtag on Instagram. There are a few things you can do to maximize your chances of getting your post into the spotlight.</p><ul><li><strong>Pick the right hashtags:</strong> If you want to trend for a hashtag, avoid the massive tags unless you already have more than 10k followers. Something like #dietgoals is more likely to steer you towards a top post than something huge like #instafood.</li><li><strong>Punch for maximum engagement:</strong> Focus on getting high levels of engagement as quickly as possible by scheduling your post to go live when your audience is most active. Research your target market, consider time zones and use a scheduling tool to optimize your post if you can’t be online at precisely the right time.</li><li><strong>Add some biggies too:</strong> Using between three and five of the really big hashtags are likely to boost engagement too. You aren’t likely to hit the top post for these, but should acquire a ton of likes and comments, which will help your target hashtag to rank higher too.</li></ul><p>Breaking into the top posts takes some dedication, trial and error and a good level of commitment. It’s all dependent on the Instagram algorithm, the workings of which is a closely guarded secret, but by following these tips you’ll give your post the best chance of success.</p><p>Now you know not only how to hashtag on Instagram, but also why and which ones to use. Why not try reviewing your hashtag strategy and see what results you can get?

What types of hashtags are there?"></a>3.  What types of hashtags are there?</h4><p>When deciding how to use hashtags on Instagram, it’s important to recognize the various types of hashtags so that you can pick the right ones for you. The right hashtags will depend on your goals as a business, as well as the type of content you are sharing at that time. For example:</p><ul><li><strong>Product, service and general hashtags:</strong> These might be what you do as a business (e.g. #painter) or what product you sell (e.g. #furniture). They are good for brands who want to make their work or products better known but can be difficult to achieve engagement for as there tends to be high competition.</li><li>**Niche hashtags:**For more chance of being seen, niche hashtags reduce the competition by being more specific about your product or service. For example, #ladiesshoes rather than just #shoes will be found by more people specifically interested in shoes, while #ladiesheels will reach an even more interested audience.</li><li><strong>Interest hashtags:</strong> To reach enthusiasts in your niche, use interest related hashtags that describe your post. Research popular tags from the top posts section or see what specific groups are using to tag their posts. For instance, #shoeaholics or #heelsofInstagram will engage with those passionate about amazing footwear.</li><li><strong>Location hashtags:</strong> As you might have guessed, these tags are specifically the places where the content was show, for example #UK, #london or #hammersmith will find users who are interested in products, services or images from that location. You could also combine these with your service to narrow the audience even further, for instance #heelsinlondon or #londonfashionblogger.</li><li><strong>Branded hashtags:</strong> These types of hashtags are often used by businesses on Instagram to promote their brand or a particular ad campaign. You might promote the name of your business, e.g. #divashoes, or a slogan you are pushing, such as #comfortfit. However, be aware these don’t tend to get more followers on their own, because people won’t be searching for or adding branded hashtags to their posts unless they are compelled to do so. However, they can be great for engagement during a live event, for creating contests and to position your brand deeper in your audience’s mind, so use them where you can.</li></ul><p>Understanding these different types of hashtags will help you understand how to use hashtags on Instagram better, by lacing your post with a variety of suitable tags.</p><h4 id="4-How-to-add-a-hashtag-to-your-post-1"><a href="#4-How-to-add-a-hashtag-to-your-post-1" class="headerlink" title="4.

You can add tags as either captions to your post or in the comments area. As long as your account is public, the hashtag will ensure your post is discoverable via the corresponding hashtag page. Here’s how it works:</p><ul><li>Upload a photo or video to your Instagram account</li><li>Pick your filters and edit as required</li><li>Type the hash (#) symbol in the caption field followed by the text you want to be indexed for</li><li>Tap OK</li><li>Then share</li></ul><p>If you prefer to add your hashtag to the comments section, just find the post and type in your hashtag in the comments section. This is particularly good if you plan to use a lot of hashtags and don’t want to make your post look too messy.</p><p>Letters, numbers and emojis work as hashtags, but special characters and spaces do not. Don’t add in any symbols like * or %, and type words altogether without any spaces.

Click in the search bar and begin your query with a #. Instagram will present you with a list of suggestions as you start to type, as well as how many posts have been tagged with that particular hashtag. If you don’t know where to start, think about what your business does, provides or specializes in as a good launchpad. If you already have a list of keywords you use for SEO or PPC, this can be a great source of initial inspiration.</li><li><strong>Competition:</strong> If there are other businesses already on Instagram who are in your niche, maybe who have a sizeable following already, they may well already be leveraging a hashtag strategy which you can learn from. Visit their account and see which hashtags they use on a regular basis. If they’re posting the same tags over and over again, there’s a good chance they’ve already done a bit of trial and error research and have discovered the ones that work.</li><li><strong>Related:</strong> If you’ve got a hashtag or two already that you get good engagement from, visit the pages for those hashtags and see what else is posted alongside them. There may be other hashtag trends relating to your business that you haven’t thought of yet, and could try including in future posts.</li><li><strong>Influencers:</strong> Who are the biggest influencers in your industry? Is there a blogger who simply loves products like yours? If so, check out what hashtags they use, and follow along with their favorites to reach the people who follow them. Their audience is essentially the same as yours, so why not learn from the experts?</li></ul><p>Avoid using ‘spammy’ hashtags such as #like4like, #followme, #follow4follow and #followback.

They are good for brands who want to make their work or products better known but can be difficult to achieve engagement for as there tends to be high competition.</li><li>**Niche hashtags:**For more chance of being seen, niche hashtags reduce the competition by being more specific about your product or service. For example, #ladiesshoes rather than just #shoes will be found by more people specifically interested in shoes, while #ladiesheels will reach an even more interested audience.</li><li><strong>Interest hashtags:</strong> To reach enthusiasts in your niche, use interest related hashtags that describe your post. Research popular tags from the top posts section or see what specific groups are using to tag their posts. For instance, #shoeaholics or #heelsofInstagram will engage with those passionate about amazing footwear.</li><li><strong>Location hashtags:</strong> As you might have guessed, these tags are specifically the places where the content was show, for example #UK, #london or #hammersmith will find users who are interested in products, services or images from that location. You could also combine these with your service to narrow the audience even further, for instance #heelsinlondon or #londonfashionblogger.</li><li><strong>Branded hashtags:</strong> These types of hashtags are often used by businesses on Instagram to promote their brand or a particular ad campaign. You might promote the name of your business, e.g. #divashoes, or a slogan you are pushing, such as #comfortfit. However, be aware these don’t tend to get more followers on their own, because people won’t be searching for or adding branded hashtags to their posts unless they are compelled to do so. However, they can be great for engagement during a live event, for creating contests and to position your brand deeper in your audience’s mind, so use them where you can.</li></ul><p>Understanding these different types of hashtags will help you understand how to use hashtags on Instagram better, by lacing your post with a variety of suitable tags.</p><h4 id="4-How-to-add-a-hashtag-to-your-post-3"><a href="#4-How-to-add-a-hashtag-to-your-post-3" class="headerlink" title="4.  How to add a hashtag to your post"></a>4.  How to add a hashtag to your post</h4><p>If you’re not sure how to hashtag on Instagram, here’s a quick walkthrough. You can add tags as either captions to your post or in the comments area. As long as your account is public, the hashtag will ensure your post is discoverable via the corresponding hashtag page. Here’s how it works:</p><ul><li>Upload a photo or video to your Instagram account</li><li>Pick your filters and edit as required</li><li>Type the hash (#) symbol in the caption field followed by the text you want to be indexed for</li><li>Tap OK</li><li>Then share</li></ul><p>If you prefer to add your hashtag to the comments section, just find the post and type in your hashtag in the comments section. This is particularly good if you plan to use a lot of hashtags and don’t want to make your post look too messy.</p><p>Letters, numbers and emojis work as hashtags, but special characters and spaces do not. Don’t add in any symbols like * or %, and type words altogether without any spaces. You cannot add hashtags to other people’s posts, only your own, and can use up to 30 tags on any single post.</p><h4 id="5-How-to-find-the-best-hashtags-for-your-brand-3"><a href="#5-How-to-find-the-best-hashtags-for-your-brand-3" class="headerlink" title="5.  How to find the best hashtags for your brand"></a>5.  How to find the best hashtags for your brand</h4><p>If you’re not sure how to find the best hashtags for Instagram, there are a few options open to you:</p><ul><li><strong>Search:</strong> Just doing a simple search can throw up some interesting hashtags and useful data for your post. Click in the search bar and begin your query with a #. Instagram will present you with a list of suggestions as you start to type, as well as how many posts have been tagged with that particular hashtag. If you don’t know where to start, think about what your business does, provides or specializes in as a good launchpad. If you already have a list of keywords you use for SEO or PPC, this can be a great source of initial inspiration.</li><li><strong>Competition:</strong> If there are other businesses already on Instagram who are in your niche, maybe who have a sizeable following already, they may well already be leveraging a hashtag strategy which you can learn from. Visit their account and see which hashtags they use on a regular basis. If they’re posting the same tags over and over again, there’s a good chance they’ve already done a bit of trial and error research and have discovered the ones that work.</li><li><strong>Related:</strong> If you’ve got a hashtag or two already that you get good engagement from, visit the pages for those hashtags and see what else is posted alongside them. There may be other hashtag trends relating to your business that you haven’t thought of yet, and could try including in future posts.</li><li><strong>Influencers:</strong> Who are the biggest influencers in your industry? Is there a blogger who simply loves products like yours? If so, check out what hashtags they use, and follow along with their favorites to reach the people who follow them. Their audience is essentially the same as yours, so why not learn from the experts?</li></ul><p>Avoid using ‘spammy’ hashtags such as #like4like, #followme, #follow4follow and #followback. These are insanely popular among low quality Instagramers who simply want more followers, without caring about the quality. Stick to carefully chosen, related hashtags to gain valuable followers for your business.</p><h4 id="6-How-many-hashtags-should-you-use-3"><a href="#6-How-many-hashtags-should-you-use-3" class="headerlink" title="6.  How many hashtags should you use?"></a>6.  How many hashtags should you use?</h4><p>No doubt you’ve uncovered a great list of potential hashtags for your Instagram posts, but how many should you use in each posting? Instagram is less strict than Twitter, in that you can use up to 30 hashtags per post. However, that doesn’t mean you should go all out on every post, so how many is enough?</p><p>For some insight into the ‘norm’, you can take a look at influencers and competitors and see how many hashtags they tend to use. You can also conduct a bit of trial and error testing to see how to use hashtags on Instagram to their full effect, by varying the number you use and tracking the results.</p><p>Research conducted last year found that there is certainly a case for the more the merrier. Buffer discovered that engagement was greatest on posts with 11 hashtags, at 79.5 per cent compared to just 29 per cent for one. A separate study by TrackMaven found that nine hashtags performed best.</p><p>As a general rule, there is no rule. Optimum hashtag numbers will depend on your industry, but there’s no need to be stingy as more definitely is more. Remember to test and adapt to the response you are getting to make hashtags work for your brand.</p><h4 id="7-How-to-get-onto-Top-Posts-3"><a href="#7-How-to-get-onto-Top-Posts-3" class="headerlink" title="7.  How to get onto Top Posts"></a>7.  How to get onto Top Posts</h4><p>Getting bumped up to a Top Post is the holy grail of how to hashtag on Instagram. There are a few things you can do to maximize your chances of getting your post into the spotlight.</p><ul><li><strong>Pick the right hashtags:</strong> If you want to trend for a hashtag, avoid the massive tags unless you already have more than 10k followers. Something like #dietgoals is more likely to steer you towards a top post than something huge like #instafood.</li><li><strong>Punch for maximum engagement:</strong> Focus on getting high levels of engagement as quickly as possible by scheduling your post to go live when your audience is most active. Research your target market, consider time zones and use a scheduling tool to optimize your post if you can’t be online at precisely the right time.</li><li><strong>Add some biggies too:</strong> Using between three and five of the really big hashtags are likely to boost engagement too. You aren’t likely to hit the top post for these, but should acquire a ton of likes and comments, which will help your target hashtag to rank higher too.</li></ul><p>Breaking into the top posts takes some dedication, trial and error and a good level of commitment. It’s all dependent on the Instagram algorithm, the workings of which is a closely guarded secret, but by following these tips you’ll give your post the best chance of success.</p><p>Now you know not only how to hashtag on Instagram, but also why and which ones to use. Why not try reviewing your hashtag strategy and see what results you can get?
