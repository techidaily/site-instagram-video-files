As you explore all these features, remember to use the specified Max Instagram video dimensions in this article.</p><h3 id="1-Instagram-Video-Dimensions-And-Sizes"><a href="#1-Instagram-Video-Dimensions-And-Sizes" class="headerlink" title="#1 - Instagram Video Dimensions And Sizes"></a>#1 - Instagram Video Dimensions And Sizes</h3><p>To optimize these Instagram video orientations, here are the dimensional specifications you need to know:</p><h4 id="Instagram-Square-Videos"><a href="#Instagram-Square-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Instagram Square Videos"></a>Instagram Square Videos</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/instagram-square-videos.jpg"                      alt="best video dimensions for instagram"                ></p><p>Since the launch of Instagram video sharing feature, square videos are the most successful orientation. To occupy a larger space to attract more attention, we recommend square videos. Use the following Instagram square video dimensions to produce high-quality videos.</p><ul><li>Maximum Instagram file size is 4GB</li><li>The aspect ratio should be 1:1 with minimum dimension of 600px by 600px and a maximum of 1080px by 1080px.</li><li>Video codecs should be , VP8</li><li>Maximum frame rate is 30fps</li></ul><h4 id="Instagram-Horizontal-Videos-Landscape"><a href="#Instagram-Horizontal-Videos-Landscape" class="headerlink" title="Instagram Horizontal Videos (Landscape)"></a>Instagram Horizontal Videos (Landscape)</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/instagram-horizontal-videos.jpg"                      alt="instagram video format"                ></p><p>Even though recording Instagram videos in a landscape form is a lot much easier, the majority of Instagram enthusiasts despise. It is the least used orientation mostly because it occupies a small space and the quality appears distorted.</p><p>To recorded landscape videos, set the dimensions in the aspect ratio of 16:9 or 1.91:1. In a situation where shooting videos in the landscape is necessary, we recommend the 16:9 Instagram size ratio. The maximum dimensions should be set at 1080px by 607px, which is the set cinematic standard.</p><h4 id="Instagram-Vertical-Video-Portrait"><a href="#Instagram-Vertical-Video-Portrait" class="headerlink" title="Instagram Vertical Video (Portrait)"></a>Instagram Vertical Video (Portrait)</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/instagram-vertical-videos.jpg"                      alt="instagram vertical video dimensions"                ></p><p>Vertical videos differ from square videos by very small margins. For your portrait videos to attract many viewers, ensure it is of the highest quality and has an aspect ratio of 4:5. This ratio has to coincide with a 1080px by 1350px dimension.</p><h3 id="2-Instagram-Story-Dimensions"><a href="#2-Instagram-Story-Dimensions" class="headerlink" title="#2 - Instagram Story Dimensions"></a>#2 - Instagram Story Dimensions</h3><p>Instagram story option started in 2016. According to <a class="link"   href="https://buffer.com/library/instagram-stories" >Buffer <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, to maintain story completion rate above 70%, your story frames should range from one to seven. Moreover, because Instagram stories last for 24 hours, use aspect ratio you are certain will display high-resolution frames.</p><p>Instagram story size is less stringed compared to the videos. Instagram allows its users to upload photos and videos for creating a story with an aspect ratio of between 1.91:1 and 9:16. Below or above these ratios, the story will have borders and thus affect its quality.</p><p>The best Instagram story size is be 1080px by 1920px.</p><h4 id="3-Instagram-Carousel-Ads-Dimensions"><a href="#3-Instagram-Carousel-Ads-Dimensions" class="headerlink" title="#3 - Instagram Carousel Ads Dimensions"></a>#3 - Instagram Carousel Ads Dimensions</h4><p>Just like the Instagram story, carousel ads are created from videos and images. They are mostly used by advertisers to showcase multiple products in a single ad. To create Instagram carousel ads, you also require a thumbnail image with 1:1 aspect ration and text whose dimensions less than 20% the size of image space.</p><p>Due to the many Instagram carousel ads dimension requirements, it is a bit challenging to create perfect ads. Good carousel ads should have a combination of 2-10 images and videos.</p><p>But since you’ve to create it anyway, use these Instagram carousel image sizes:</p><ul><li>Carousel Image resolution- 1080px by 1080px</li><li>Maximum single image size- 3MB</li><li>Aspect ratio of 1:1</li></ul><p>Your Instagram carousel video sizes should have:</p><ul><li>A maximum length of 60 seconds</li><li>An aspect ratio of 1:1</li><li>Have an MP4 format</li><li>A maximum size of 1080px by 1920px and a minimum size of 600px by 600px</li><li>Maximum size of 4GB</li></ul><h4 id="4-Instagram-IGTV-Video-Dimensions"><a href="#4-Instagram-IGTV-Video-Dimensions" class="headerlink" title="#4 - Instagram IGTV Video Dimensions"></a>#4 - Instagram IGTV Video Dimensions</h4><p>IGTV (Instagram TV) is a feature used for sharing videos. Even though Instagram recommends IGTV videos with vertical and horizontal video formats, it displays the vertical format.</p><p>Since you require a cover photo for the videos, ensure it has an aspect ratio of 1:1.15 and size of 420px by 654px.</p><p>For your IG videos to be accepted, use the following specified IGTV video sizes:</p><ul><li>IGTV video length if uploading from mobile -15 minutes</li><li>Video length when uploading from web – 60 minutes</li><li>Aspect ratio - 9:16&#x2F; 16:9</li><li>Minimum video frame rate- 30fps</li><li>Minimum resolution – 720px</li><li>Maximum video size of fewer than 10 minutes – 650MB</li><li>Maximum video size of up to 60 minutes – 3.6GB</li><li>Video size - 1920px by 1080px &#x2F; 1080px by 1920px</li></ul><h4 id="5-Instagram-Live-Video-dimensions"><a href="#5-Instagram-Live-Video-dimensions" class="headerlink" title="#5 - Instagram Live Video dimensions"></a>#5 - Instagram Live Video dimensions</h4><p>Want to know the juicy part of Instagram? Try Instagram live video. Broadcasting your interview, illustrating how to prepare a tasty meal or streaming your wedding on Instagram can be really exciting.</p><p>Instagram live video is broadcast in a vertical format. No much dimensional requirements are specified except the aspect ratio.</p><p>The only Instagram Live video requirement is using portrait orientation with an Instagram aspect ratio of 9:16.</p><p>With all these different Instagram video dimension specifications, how long can Instagram videos be? Here is a brief of how long are Instagram videos:</p><ul><li>regular Instagram video post – 15 seconds</li><li>Instagram live video – 60 minutes</li><li>IGTV videos- 15 seconds to 10 minutes, verified accounts post 60-minute videos</li></ul><h4 id="6-Requirements-for-Instagram-Photo-Sizes"><a href="#6-Requirements-for-Instagram-Photo-Sizes" class="headerlink" title="#6 - Requirements for Instagram Photo Sizes"></a>#6 - Requirements for Instagram Photo Sizes</h4><p>Individuals and businesses are increasingly relying on photographs to promote their profiles and products on Instagram. As millions of photos are uploaded on Instagram every day, Instagram photo sizes are now of concern to every user.</p><p>Unlike the Instagram video complexities, photos have much easier to edit and upload. However, the freedom to share Instagram photos in landscape and portrait formats began in 2015. Initially, people only used the square format (aspect ratio 1:1).</p><p>Now that you have the options to share photos in different sizes, what is the best size for Instagram photos? Here is the answer:</p><p>Wait!</p><p>What is your Instagram profile picture size? It is your trademark! Therefore, it matters a lot. On the smartphone, set the Instagram profile photo at 110px by 110px. Since the computer has a higher resolution, make the profile image size to be 180px by 180px.</p><h4 id="Instagram-Square-Photo-Size"><a href="#Instagram-Square-Photo-Size" class="headerlink" title="Instagram Square Photo Size"></a>Instagram Square Photo Size</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/instagram-square-photo-size.jpg"                      alt="instagram story dimensions"                ></p><p>As said earlier, your square photos should have an aspect ratio of 1:1. To retain original photo qualities of, these are the right Instagram picture sizes to use:</p><ul><li>Minimum picture size: 320px by 320px</li><li>Maximum picture size: 1080px by 1080px</li></ul><p>This is how using extra small or larger photos than recommended affects quality. When you upload a picture with a size below 320 X 320, Instagram enlarges it making pixelated. On the other hand, photo compression occurs when it is larger than 1080 X 1080 resulting in a loss of repeated data on the picture.</p><h4 id="Instagram-Portrait-Photo-Size"><a href="#Instagram-Portrait-Photo-Size" class="headerlink" title="Instagram Portrait Photo Size"></a>Instagram Portrait Photo Size</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/instagram-portrait-photo-size.jpg"                      alt="instagram story size"                ></p><p>For images or photos whose height is naturally greater than width, the ideal Instagram photo format to use is portrait. To avoid cropping your photos, use the 4:5 aspect ratio. The photo dimension should not exceed 1080px by 1350px.</p><p>Even though Instagram displays vertical photos at a maximum resolution of 480px by 600px or 960 X 1200, let your photo size 1080 X 1350. Otherwise, the effects of enlargement and compression will occur.</p><h4 id="Instagram-Landscape-Photo-Size"><a href="#Instagram-Landscape-Photo-Size" class="headerlink" title="Instagram Landscape Photo Size"></a>Instagram Landscape Photo Size</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/instagram-landscape-photo-size.jpg"                      alt="instagram post size"                ></p><p>How many photos or pictures have you seen on Instagram with a border above and below it? They are countless.</p><p>Using the wrong aspect ratio is the main cause of this effect. It is a bit challenging to set the recommended aspect ratio of 1.91:1.</p><p>You are permitted to upload photos with a high aspect ratio as 16:9. However, these extra sizes will display in the form of a black border.</p><p>If you want to upload horizontal photos and maintain their original quality, the right Instagram image size is 1080px by 608px.</p><h2 id="Well-Prepare-Your-Instagram-Videos-and-Photos-with-the-Best-Editing-Software"><a href="#Well-Prepare-Your-Instagram-Videos-and-Photos-with-the-Best-Editing-Software" class="headerlink" title="Well Prepare Your Instagram Videos and Photos with the Best Editing Software"></a>Well Prepare Your Instagram Videos and Photos with the Best Editing Software</h2><p>The best method to publish high-quality Instagram videos and photos is to edit them before publishing.</p><p>To share well-edit photos and videos, it is good to use a video editor.

Here is the answer:</p><p>Wait!</p><p>What is your Instagram profile picture size? It is your trademark! Therefore, it matters a lot. On the smartphone, set the Instagram profile photo at 110px by 110px. Since the computer has a higher resolution, make the profile image size to be 180px by 180px.</p><h4 id="Instagram-Square-Photo-Size-3"><a href="#Instagram-Square-Photo-Size-3" class="headerlink" title="Instagram Square Photo Size"></a>Instagram Square Photo Size</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/instagram-square-photo-size.jpg"                      alt="instagram story dimensions"                ></p><p>As said earlier, your square photos should have an aspect ratio of 1:1.

When you upload a picture with a size below 320 X 320, Instagram enlarges it making pixelated. On the other hand, photo compression occurs when it is larger than 1080 X 1080 resulting in a loss of repeated data on the picture.</p><h4 id="Instagram-Portrait-Photo-Size-3"><a href="#Instagram-Portrait-Photo-Size-3" class="headerlink" title="Instagram Portrait Photo Size"></a>Instagram Portrait Photo Size</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/instagram-portrait-photo-size.jpg"                      alt="instagram story size"                ></p><p>For images or photos whose height is naturally greater than width, the ideal Instagram photo format to use is portrait.

Since its inception, Instagram has grown in popularity as a method to engage with brands, celebrities, thought leaders, friends, family, and more. The launch of Instagram’s IGTv function was a great success, and the platform isn’t stopping there. Soon later, in the summer of 2019, Instagram added a new feature: you may now video chat with one or more of your friends in direct messaging without having to leave Instagram. This innovation will help Instagram to retain its users on the platform for longer than before, obviating the need for third-party programs such as Skype and Facetime.</p><h4 id="In-this-article-3"><a href="#In-this-article-3" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 <a href="#part1">What Is The Most Important Information You Should Know About Instagram?</a></p><p>02 <a href="#part2">How To Use Instagram Video Chat?</a></p><p>03 <a href="#part3">Things You Should Pay Attention To While Using Youtube Video Chat</a></p><h2 id="What-Is-The-Most-Important-Information-You-Should-Know-About-Instagram-3"><a href="#What-Is-The-Most-Important-Information-You-Should-Know-About-Instagram-3" class="headerlink" title="What Is The Most Important Information You Should Know About Instagram?"></a>What Is The Most Important Information You Should Know About Instagram?</h2><p>Instagram is a photo and video-sharing social networking platform with a smartphone app. You may create, modify, and share visual content so that your followers can interact with it through likes, comments</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/instagram-video-chat-1.jpg"                      alt="instgram video chat"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2105866/7443" target="_top" id="2105866">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2105866" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2105866/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h4 id="When-Is-It-Introduced-3"><a href="#When-Is-It-Introduced-3" class="headerlink" title="When Is It Introduced?"></a>When Is It Introduced?</h4><p>Instagram is the most popular social networking platform in the world.

How Does Instagram Organize the Story Views?"></a>1. How Does Instagram Organize the Story Views?</h2><p>Over just a decade ago, Instagram has grown to become one of the most popular social media platforms with over 1 billion active users worldwide. Instagram is constantly evolving and introducing intriguing updates, intuitive design, and crazy monetization features. What started as a picture editing and sharing app, has now become a crazy online business tool. Celebrities, influencers, entrepreneurs and multi-billion corporations are all using Instagram to directly engage with their target audience and get new customers.</p><p>With millions of people using the app every day, Instagram has to constantly upgrade its algorithm to maintain transparency – so, cheats, no shortcuts, and no hacks! Instagram algorithms are based on engagement, hashtags, shout-outs, and other factors. However, engagement elements like comments, likes, saves, and views determine most content that will appear on the feed.</p><p>Instagram uses the same algorithm to organize the story feeds as well. Thus, how you engage and connect with your followers and audience will determine, how Instagram organizes the placement of your story and your story views.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/1-instagram-story-viewer.jpg"                      alt="instagram-story-viewer"                ></p><h2 id="2-The-Instagram-Story-Viewer-List"><a href="#2-The-Instagram-Story-Viewer-List" class="headerlink" title="2. The Instagram Story Viewer List?"></a>2. The Instagram Story Viewer List?</h2><p>Instagram has two feeds, a vertical feed, and a horizontal feed. The vertical feed shows shared posts like an image, boomerang or reel. And, the vertical feed at the top of the page is the story feed. The story feed presents the micro user content. These are 15-second-long videos that appear for instant interaction with the followers. Instagram uses advanced algorithms to organize the feed and views.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2-instagram-story-viewer-list.jpg"                      alt="instagram-story-viewer-list"                ></p><p>Each story that people see generates views. These views are arranged in a story viewer list. Instagram story viewers list is the one that contains all your story views. To access this list:</p><ul><li>Open your Instagram app and tap on your profile picture at the top of your feed</li><li>If you have put up story there, look at the lower-left corner of the picture&#x2F;boomerang&#x2F;video</li><li>Here the people who viewed your stories will appear under the tag “Seen by #” (The “Seen by #” label will show how who and how many of among your followers have seen your story)</li><li>Tap on Seen by # to open the story viewers list</li></ul><h2 id="3-What’s-The-Instagram-Story-Viewer-Order"><a href="#3-What’s-The-Instagram-Story-Viewer-Order" class="headerlink" title="3. What’s The Instagram Story Viewer Order?"></a>3. What’s The Instagram Story Viewer Order?</h2><p>Previously Instagram story views were arranged in chronological order. However, in 2021 the story views are organized based on engagement.

How Does Instagram Organize the Story Views?"></a>1. How Does Instagram Organize the Story Views?</h2><p>Over just a decade ago, Instagram has grown to become one of the most popular social media platforms with over 1 billion active users worldwide. Instagram is constantly evolving and introducing intriguing updates, intuitive design, and crazy monetization features. What started as a picture editing and sharing app, has now become a crazy online business tool. Celebrities, influencers, entrepreneurs and multi-billion corporations are all using Instagram to directly engage with their target audience and get new customers.</p><p>With millions of people using the app every day, Instagram has to constantly upgrade its algorithm to maintain transparency – so, cheats, no shortcuts, and no hacks! Instagram algorithms are based on engagement, hashtags, shout-outs, and other factors. However, engagement elements like comments, likes, saves, and views determine most content that will appear on the feed.</p><p>Instagram uses the same algorithm to organize the story feeds as well. Thus, how you engage and connect with your followers and audience will determine, how Instagram organizes the placement of your story and your story views.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/1-instagram-story-viewer.jpg"                      alt="instagram-story-viewer"                ></p><h2 id="2-The-Instagram-Story-Viewer-List-3"><a href="#2-The-Instagram-Story-Viewer-List-3" class="headerlink" title="2. The Instagram Story Viewer List?"></a>2. The Instagram Story Viewer List?</h2><p>Instagram has two feeds, a vertical feed, and a horizontal feed. The vertical feed shows shared posts like an image, boomerang or reel. And, the vertical feed at the top of the page is the story feed. The story feed presents the micro user content. These are 15-second-long videos that appear for instant interaction with the followers. Instagram uses advanced algorithms to organize the feed and views.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2-instagram-story-viewer-list.jpg"                      alt="instagram-story-viewer-list"                ></p><p>Each story that people see generates views. These views are arranged in a story viewer list. Instagram story viewers list is the one that contains all your story views. To access this list:</p><ul><li>Open your Instagram app and tap on your profile picture at the top of your feed</li><li>If you have put up story there, look at the lower-left corner of the picture&#x2F;boomerang&#x2F;video</li><li>Here the people who viewed your stories will appear under the tag “Seen by #” (The “Seen by #” label will show how who and how many of among your followers have seen your story)</li><li>Tap on Seen by # to open the story viewers list</li></ul><h2 id="3-What’s-The-Instagram-Story-Viewer-Order-3"><a href="#3-What’s-The-Instagram-Story-Viewer-Order-3" class="headerlink" title="3. What’s The Instagram Story Viewer Order?"></a>3. What’s The Instagram Story Viewer Order?</h2><p>Previously Instagram story views were arranged in chronological order. However, in 2021 the story views are organized based on engagement. The new Instagram algorithm shows the accounts you engage with the most at the top of your story views list.</p><p>Similarly, the more engagement you have with the follower the more chances are of that follower to be at the top of the views list. These accounts are those that give you the most likes, comments, DMs, profile visits, saves etc. But this algorithm only works for those who get more than 50 views. If your story gets under 50 views then the list is sequential meaning that the one who watches your stories first will show up at the top of the list.</p><h2 id="4-How-Does-Instagram-Sorts-Instagram-Story-Viewers-3"><a href="#4-How-Does-Instagram-Sorts-Instagram-Story-Viewers-3" class="headerlink" title="4.

A newbie can extract quality content and product engagement or personal use.</p><p><strong>Why Square Videos?</strong></p><p>It may surprise us, but square videos have recently received a lot of attention, and the reason for this is not forgotten.</p><p>One important reason for this popularity is that social media platforms such as Facebook, TikTok, and Instagram are the ideal square video games.</p><p>Square videos take up a lot of screen space, especially in viewer feeds, rather than landscape video. The more your screen takes the user’s screen, the better. It may interest you to know that the screen-filling videos are very attractive.</p><p>There are various benefits to using the iMovie app. As mentioned earlier, the app has features for adjusting and enlarging video color settings, cropping and rotating video clips, stabilizing unstable videos, and increasing video transitions (such as blurring and speed changes). Video clip effects include cropping, using a green&#x2F;blue screen to extract a title, replacing the background with a different clip, screen splitting, and making a photo-picture effect.</p><p>By removing background sound and raising audio levels for silent clips, iMovie can also help to convert and enhance video audio.</p><p>Movie trailers can be created using templates provided in iMovie. The trailer tool in iMovie makes it easy to drop clips on a timeline, separated by a panel board with labels indicating what type of clip should be placed in each window.</p><p>A guide to adding titles and credits to the cart is also included in the template. There is no doubt that using iMovie can get a beginner a unique video spark. It can get the industry any updates needed. Developers can use app previews to give users a quick overview of the app using video rather than graphics.</p><p>Let’s look at how to generate square movies for Instagram with iMovie now.</p><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Make-a-Square-Video-for-Instagram-in-iMovie-on-iPhone"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Make-a-Square-Video-for-Instagram-in-iMovie-on-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. How to Make a Square Video for Instagram in iMovie on iPhone?"></a>Part 1. How to Make a Square Video for Instagram in iMovie on iPhone?</h2><p>Videos are a fantastic way to keep memories alive, but some social media platforms - specifically, Instagram - demand videos to be a certain size and length before they can be uploaded. Fortunately, cropping your video before sharing it is a straightforward process. Here are some pointers to help you crop a movie and modify the screen size to whatever you want. Cropping your films is useful for a variety of reasons. Perhaps you’d like to focus on a specific component of the film or get rid of your thumb from the screen’s corner. You’ll need iMovie, which comes preloaded on most iPhones, to crop a video on your iPhone. If your phone does not already have iMovie, you may get it for free from the App Store. The size or aspect ratio of your video will not change if you use this method. It will just zoom in on your video and possibly crop out any unwanted things.</p><p>To use the crop&#x2F;zoom feature in iMovie on iPhone, follow these steps:</p><p><strong>Step #1.</strong> On your iPhone, open the iMovie app.</p><p><strong>Step #2.</strong> Navigate to <strong>Projects</strong>.</p><p><strong>Step #3.</strong> The enormous + sign should be tapped. Choose a movie.</p><p><strong>Step #4.</strong> Go to the video you want to crop and select it, then press <strong>Create Movie</strong> at the bottom of the screen.</p><p><strong>Step #5.</strong> Three portions will appear on your screen. In the lower left-hand corner of the screen, tap the timeline section.</p><p><strong>Step #6.</strong> In the upper right-hand corner of the screen, tap the small magnifying glass.</p><p><strong>Step #7.</strong> You may now zoom in and out of your movie with your thumb and forefinger.</p><p><strong>Step #8.</strong> Press the play button to see a preview of the video.</p><p><strong>Step #9.</strong> Tap <strong>Done</strong> in the top left corner when you’re satisfied with the results.</p><p><strong>Step #10.</strong> To save your movie to your Camera Roll, tap the square with an arrow icon.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Make-a-Square-Video-in-iMovie-on-Mac"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Make-a-Square-Video-in-iMovie-on-Mac" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. How to Make a Square Video in iMovie on Mac?"></a>Part 2. How to Make a Square Video in iMovie on Mac?</h2><p>iMovie does not allow you to make square videos! You won’t be able to convert your video to square dimensions because there isn’t a way to do it. We’ll edit the video in iMovie and then modify the proportions in Keynote. Only Keynote will be used to crop the video into square dimensions. On Mac OS, Keynote is a presentation program that comes preloaded. First, use iMovie to edit your video as you typically would. Make all of the necessary modifications to the audio and video. Make use of iMovie’s special editing features. After you’ve finished editing the video, export it from iMovie.</p><p>Let’s adjust the dimensions of your video to square using Keynote now that you’ve edited and polished it in iMovie:</p><p><strong>Step #1.</strong> Select the “Basic White” theme from the Basic section of Keynote.</p><p><strong>Step #2.</strong> To select the text boxes, click and drag (or use “cmd + A”) them, then tap “delete”.</p><p><strong>Step #3.</strong> The video should now be dragged and dropped onto the blank slide. Click the <strong>Document</strong> tab in the top right corner of the screen, then pick “Custom Slide Size…” from the <strong>Slide Size</strong> dropdown menu.</p><p><strong>Step #4.</strong> To make a square video, make sure that both the width and height of the movie are the same. For example, if the video’s width is 500 pixels, the height should be 500 pixels as well. Once you’ve finished customizing the width and height of the slide, click “OK” to save it in these dimensions.</p><p><strong>Step #5.</strong> Drag one of your video’s corners out to make it fit the square proportions appropriately.</p><p><strong>Step #6.</strong> Click the <strong>Text</strong> button in the top center of the screen to add text to your square video. Simply drag and drop your logo or any other pictures into the video to add them.</p><p><strong>Step #7.</strong> To change the background color, first click on the white background area, then go to the <strong>Format</strong> tab in the top right corner and select a color from the <strong>Background</strong> section.</p><p><strong>Step #8.</strong> Finally, click “File” &gt; “Export To” &gt; “Movie…” to export the video. There will be a popup window. Choose a video resolution and then click <strong>Next</strong>.</p><p><strong>Step #9.</strong> Select a location to save your square video and then click <strong>Export</strong>.</p><h2 id="Bonus-Tip-How-to-Easily-Make-a-Square-Video-for-Social-Media-on-Mac"><a href="#Bonus-Tip-How-to-Easily-Make-a-Square-Video-for-Social-Media-on-Mac" class="headerlink" title="Bonus Tip - How to Easily Make a Square Video for Social Media on Mac?"></a>Bonus Tip - How to Easily Make a Square Video for Social Media on Mac?</h2><p>Facebook is dominating the top ranks in video consumption platforms across the internet, thanks to its high video consumption rate.

How to Make a Square Video for Instagram in iMovie on iPhone?</h2><p>Videos are a fantastic way to keep memories alive, but some social media platforms - specifically, Instagram - demand videos to be a certain size and length before they can be uploaded. Fortunately, cropping your video before sharing it is a straightforward process. Here are some pointers to help you crop a movie and modify the screen size to whatever you want. Cropping your films is useful for a variety of reasons. Perhaps you’d like to focus on a specific component of the film or get rid of your thumb from the screen’s corner. You’ll need iMovie, which comes preloaded on most iPhones, to crop a video on your iPhone. If your phone does not already have iMovie, you may get it for free from the App Store. The size or aspect ratio of your video will not change if you use this method. It will just zoom in on your video and possibly crop out any unwanted things.</p><p>To use the crop&#x2F;zoom feature in iMovie on iPhone, follow these steps:</p><p><strong>Step #1.</strong> On your iPhone, open the iMovie app.</p><p><strong>Step #2.</strong> Navigate to <strong>Projects</strong>.</p><p><strong>Step #3.</strong> The enormous + sign should be tapped. Choose a movie.</p><p><strong>Step #4.</strong> Go to the video you want to crop and select it, then press <strong>Create Movie</strong> at the bottom of the screen.</p><p><strong>Step #5.</strong> Three portions will appear on your screen. In the lower left-hand corner of the screen, tap the timeline section.</p><p><strong>Step #6.</strong> In the upper right-hand corner of the screen, tap the small magnifying glass.</p><p><strong>Step #7.</strong> You may now zoom in and out of your movie with your thumb and forefinger.</p><p><strong>Step #8.</strong> Press the play button to see a preview of the video.</p><p><strong>Step #9.</strong> Tap <strong>Done</strong> in the top left corner when you’re satisfied with the results.</p><p><strong>Step #10.</strong> To save your movie to your Camera Roll, tap the square with an arrow icon.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Make-a-Square-Video-in-iMovie-on-Mac-3"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Make-a-Square-Video-in-iMovie-on-Mac-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

You won’t be able to convert your video to square dimensions because there isn’t a way to do it. We’ll edit the video in iMovie and then modify the proportions in Keynote. Only Keynote will be used to crop the video into square dimensions. On Mac OS, Keynote is a presentation program that comes preloaded. First, use iMovie to edit your video as you typically would. Make all of the necessary modifications to the audio and video. Make use of iMovie’s special editing features. After you’ve finished editing the video, export it from iMovie.</p><p>Let’s adjust the dimensions of your video to square using Keynote now that you’ve edited and polished it in iMovie:</p><p><strong>Step #1.</strong> Select the “Basic White” theme from the Basic section of Keynote.</p><p><strong>Step #2.</strong> To select the text boxes, click and drag (or use “cmd + A”) them, then tap “delete”.</p><p><strong>Step #3.</strong> The video should now be dragged and dropped onto the blank slide. Click the <strong>Document</strong> tab in the top right corner of the screen, then pick “Custom Slide Size…” from the <strong>Slide Size</strong> dropdown menu.</p><p><strong>Step #4.</strong> To make a square video, make sure that both the width and height of the movie are the same. For example, if the video’s width is 500 pixels, the height should be 500 pixels as well. Once you’ve finished customizing the width and height of the slide, click “OK” to save it in these dimensions.</p><p><strong>Step #5.</strong> Drag one of your video’s corners out to make it fit the square proportions appropriately.</p><p><strong>Step #6.</strong> Click the <strong>Text</strong> button in the top center of the screen to add text to your square video. Simply drag and drop your logo or any other pictures into the video to add them.</p><p><strong>Step #7.</strong> To change the background color, first click on the white background area, then go to the <strong>Format</strong> tab in the top right corner and select a color from the <strong>Background</strong> section.</p><p><strong>Step #8.</strong> Finally, click “File” &gt; “Export To” &gt; “Movie…” to export the video. There will be a popup window. Choose a video resolution and then click <strong>Next</strong>.</p><p><strong>Step #9.</strong> Select a location to save your square video and then click <strong>Export</strong>.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137202/26400" target="_top" id="2137202">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2137202" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137202/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Bonus-Tip-How-to-Easily-Make-a-Square-Video-for-Social-Media-on-Mac-3"><a href="#Bonus-Tip-How-to-Easily-Make-a-Square-Video-for-Social-Media-on-Mac-3" class="headerlink" title="Bonus Tip - How to Easily Make a Square Video for Social Media on Mac?"></a>Bonus Tip - How to Easily Make a Square Video for Social Media on Mac?</h2><p>Facebook is dominating the top ranks in video consumption platforms across the internet, thanks to its high video consumption rate.

It is the least used orientation mostly because it occupies a small space and the quality appears distorted.</p><p>To recorded landscape videos, set the dimensions in the aspect ratio of 16:9 or 1.91:1. In a situation where shooting videos in the landscape is necessary, we recommend the 16:9 Instagram size ratio. The maximum dimensions should be set at 1080px by 607px, which is the set cinematic standard.</p><h4 id="Instagram-Vertical-Video-Portrait"><a href="#Instagram-Vertical-Video-Portrait" class="headerlink" title="Instagram Vertical Video (Portrait)"></a>Instagram Vertical Video (Portrait)</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/instagram-vertical-videos.jpg"                      alt="instagram vertical video dimensions"                ></p><p>Vertical videos differ from square videos by very small margins.

Instagram allows its users to upload photos and videos for creating a story with an aspect ratio of between 1.91:1 and 9:16.

As millions of photos are uploaded on Instagram every day, Instagram photo sizes are now of concern to every user.</p><p>Unlike the Instagram video complexities, photos have much easier to edit and upload. However, the freedom to share Instagram photos in landscape and portrait formats began in 2015. Initially, people only used the square format (aspect ratio 1:1).</p><p>Now that you have the options to share photos in different sizes, what is the best size for Instagram photos? Here is the answer:</p><p>Wait!</p><p>What is your Instagram profile picture size? It is your trademark! Therefore, it matters a lot. On the smartphone, set the Instagram profile photo at 110px by 110px. Since the computer has a higher resolution, make the profile image size to be 180px by 180px.</p><h4 id="Instagram-Square-Photo-Size"><a href="#Instagram-Square-Photo-Size" class="headerlink" title="Instagram Square Photo Size"></a>Instagram Square Photo Size</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/instagram-square-photo-size.jpg"                      alt="instagram story dimensions"                ></p><p>As said earlier, your square photos should have an aspect ratio of 1:1. To retain original photo qualities of, these are the right Instagram picture sizes to use:</p><ul><li>Minimum picture size: 320px by 320px</li><li>Maximum picture size: 1080px by 1080px</li></ul><p>This is how using extra small or larger photos than recommended affects quality. When you upload a picture with a size below 320 X 320, Instagram enlarges it making pixelated. On the other hand, photo compression occurs when it is larger than 1080 X 1080 resulting in a loss of repeated data on the picture.</p><h4 id="Instagram-Portrait-Photo-Size"><a href="#Instagram-Portrait-Photo-Size" class="headerlink" title="Instagram Portrait Photo Size"></a>Instagram Portrait Photo Size</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/instagram-portrait-photo-size.jpg"                      alt="instagram story size"                ></p><p>For images or photos whose height is naturally greater than width, the ideal Instagram photo format to use is portrait. To avoid cropping your photos, use the 4:5 aspect ratio. The photo dimension should not exceed 1080px by 1350px.</p><p>Even though Instagram displays vertical photos at a maximum resolution of 480px by 600px or 960 X 1200, let your photo size 1080 X 1350. Otherwise, the effects of enlargement and compression will occur.</p><h4 id="Instagram-Landscape-Photo-Size"><a href="#Instagram-Landscape-Photo-Size" class="headerlink" title="Instagram Landscape Photo Size"></a>Instagram Landscape Photo Size</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/instagram-landscape-photo-size.jpg"                      alt="instagram post size"                ></p><p>How many photos or pictures have you seen on Instagram with a border above and below it? They are countless.</p><p>Using the wrong aspect ratio is the main cause of this effect. It is a bit challenging to set the recommended aspect ratio of 1.91:1.</p><p>You are permitted to upload photos with a high aspect ratio as 16:9. However, these extra sizes will display in the form of a black border.</p><p>If you want to upload horizontal photos and maintain their original quality, the right Instagram image size is 1080px by 608px.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137215/26400" target="_top" id="2137215">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2137215" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137215/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Well-Prepare-Your-Instagram-Videos-and-Photos-with-the-Best-Editing-Software"><a href="#Well-Prepare-Your-Instagram-Videos-and-Photos-with-the-Best-Editing-Software" class="headerlink" title="Well Prepare Your Instagram Videos and Photos with the Best Editing Software"></a>Well Prepare Your Instagram Videos and Photos with the Best Editing Software</h2><p>The best method to publish high-quality Instagram videos and photos is to edit them before publishing.</p><p>To share well-edit photos and videos, it is good to use a video editor.

Here is the answer:</p><p>Wait!</p><p>What is your Instagram profile picture size? It is your trademark! Therefore, it matters a lot. On the smartphone, set the Instagram profile photo at 110px by 110px. Since the computer has a higher resolution, make the profile image size to be 180px by 180px.</p><h4 id="Instagram-Square-Photo-Size-1"><a href="#Instagram-Square-Photo-Size-1" class="headerlink" title="Instagram Square Photo Size"></a>Instagram Square Photo Size</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/instagram-square-photo-size.jpg"                      alt="instagram story dimensions"                ></p><p>As said earlier, your square photos should have an aspect ratio of 1:1.

No much dimensional requirements are specified except the aspect ratio.</p><p>The only Instagram Live video requirement is using portrait orientation with an Instagram aspect ratio of 9:16.</p><p>With all these different Instagram video dimension specifications, how long can Instagram videos be? Here is a brief of how long are Instagram videos:</p><ul><li>regular Instagram video post – 15 seconds</li><li>Instagram live video – 60 minutes</li><li>IGTV videos- 15 seconds to 10 minutes, verified accounts post 60-minute videos</li></ul><h4 id="6-Requirements-for-Instagram-Photo-Sizes-3"><a href="#6-Requirements-for-Instagram-Photo-Sizes-3" class="headerlink" title="#6 - Requirements for Instagram Photo Sizes"></a>#6 - Requirements for Instagram Photo Sizes</h4><p>Individuals and businesses are increasingly relying on photographs to promote their profiles and products on Instagram. As millions of photos are uploaded on Instagram every day, Instagram photo sizes are now of concern to every user.</p><p>Unlike the Instagram video complexities, photos have much easier to edit and upload. However, the freedom to share Instagram photos in landscape and portrait formats began in 2015. Initially, people only used the square format (aspect ratio 1:1).</p><p>Now that you have the options to share photos in different sizes, what is the best size for Instagram photos? Here is the answer:</p><p>Wait!</p><p>What is your Instagram profile picture size? It is your trademark! Therefore, it matters a lot. On the smartphone, set the Instagram profile photo at 110px by 110px. Since the computer has a higher resolution, make the profile image size to be 180px by 180px.</p><h4 id="Instagram-Square-Photo-Size-3"><a href="#Instagram-Square-Photo-Size-3" class="headerlink" title="Instagram Square Photo Size"></a>Instagram Square Photo Size</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/instagram-square-photo-size.jpg"                      alt="instagram story dimensions"                ></p><p>As said earlier, your square photos should have an aspect ratio of 1:1. To retain original photo qualities of, these are the right Instagram picture sizes to use:</p><ul><li>Minimum picture size: 320px by 320px</li><li>Maximum picture size: 1080px by 1080px</li></ul><p>This is how using extra small or larger photos than recommended affects quality. When you upload a picture with a size below 320 X 320, Instagram enlarges it making pixelated. On the other hand, photo compression occurs when it is larger than 1080 X 1080 resulting in a loss of repeated data on the picture.</p><h4 id="Instagram-Portrait-Photo-Size-3"><a href="#Instagram-Portrait-Photo-Size-3" class="headerlink" title="Instagram Portrait Photo Size"></a>Instagram Portrait Photo Size</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/instagram-portrait-photo-size.jpg"                      alt="instagram story size"                ></p><p>For images or photos whose height is naturally greater than width, the ideal Instagram photo format to use is portrait. To avoid cropping your photos, use the 4:5 aspect ratio. The photo dimension should not exceed 1080px by 1350px.</p><p>Even though Instagram displays vertical photos at a maximum resolution of 480px by 600px or 960 X 1200, let your photo size 1080 X 1350. Otherwise, the effects of enlargement and compression will occur.</p><h4 id="Instagram-Landscape-Photo-Size-3"><a href="#Instagram-Landscape-Photo-Size-3" class="headerlink" title="Instagram Landscape Photo Size"></a>Instagram Landscape Photo Size</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/instagram-landscape-photo-size.jpg"                      alt="instagram post size"                ></p><p>How many photos or pictures have you seen on Instagram with a border above and below it? They are countless.</p><p>Using the wrong aspect ratio is the main cause of this effect. It is a bit challenging to set the recommended aspect ratio of 1.91:1.</p><p>You are permitted to upload photos with a high aspect ratio as 16:9. However, these extra sizes will display in the form of a black border.</p><p>If you want to upload horizontal photos and maintain their original quality, the right Instagram image size is 1080px by 608px.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2082535/7443" target="_top" id="2082535">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2082535" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2082535/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Well-Prepare-Your-Instagram-Videos-and-Photos-with-the-Best-Editing-Software-3"><a href="#Well-Prepare-Your-Instagram-Videos-and-Photos-with-the-Best-Editing-Software-3" class="headerlink" title="Well Prepare Your Instagram Videos and Photos with the Best Editing Software"></a>Well Prepare Your Instagram Videos and Photos with the Best Editing Software</h2><p>The best method to publish high-quality Instagram videos and photos is to edit them before publishing.</p><p>To share well-edit photos and videos, it is good to use a video editor.

You can use a picture that has <strong>1080X1680</strong> pixels, <strong>a near 9:16 aspect ratio</strong>, as a cover photo for all IGTV videos you upload to your channel or you can choose to work with smaller images that <strong>have 420X654 pixels and a 1:1.55 aspect ratio.</strong> If you upload a cover photo that has <strong>1080X1920 pixels</strong> the platform will automatically <strong>crop approximately 120 pixels</strong> from both shorter and longer sides of the image. The size of a file you’re using for an IGTV video cover photo cannot exceed <strong>4MB,</strong> and the file must be saved as <strong>a JPEG</strong> since presently this is the only picture file format supported by IGTV.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/igtv-cover-photo-dimensions.jpg"                      alt="IGTV Cover Photo Safe Zone "                ></p><p>While creating a cover photo for an IGTV video you need to keep in mind that different graphics and text overlays are going to be displayed over the picture once you upload it to your channel. During the process of uploading IGTV video’s cover photo, you will be able to add text to it, but the <strong>Title Safe Area</strong> suggests where you can place the text without the risk of it being cropped while being viewed from different devices won’t be shown.

In case you choose to add a picture from a video you will be able to navigate to the exact point in the video where the still frame you’d like to use a cover photo is located.

A supplementary app (Hyperlapse) for Instagram is specifically developed to allow users to accelerate Instagram video speed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/hyperlapse-from-instagram.jpg"                      alt="hyperlapse from instagram"                ></p><p>You have the option of uploading a video from your iPhone or shooting a movie from inside the application. By default, your video is being played at a speed of 6X. This software, however, also has several drawbacks. For example, it can only assist you in increasing the pace of the videos. There are no editing features.</p><p>To know how to speed up a video for Instagram using Hyperlapse, follow these steps:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Launch Hyperlapse on your iPhone, press the <strong>record</strong> button. Stop filming anytime you wish and keep your hands motionless.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> You’ll see a speedometer now. The default speed is <strong>6X</strong>, but you may lower it to <strong>1X</strong> or boost it to <strong>12X</strong> if you choose. Move to the right to speed up the video.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Right after you’ve chosen your desired speed, click “OK.” If you want to share the video, you may do so on social media platforms like Instagram and Facebook.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Speed-up-Video-for-Instagram-on-Android-with-Filmora-3"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Speed-up-Video-for-Instagram-on-Android-with-Filmora-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Speed up Video for Instagram on Android with Filmora?"></a>Part 2: How to Speed up Video for Instagram on Android with Filmora?</h2><p>On Android, you do not have access to the Hyperlapse application. Hence, you will need Filmora from the Google Play store. It’s one of the most well-regarded video editing tools available.</p><p>This application allows you to convert any video into a slow or fast motion video with no effort. The most attractive feature of this tool is that it allows you to speed up different segments from a single video simultaneously. However, you can only increase the video speed by a factor of two at the most.</p><p>To know how to speed up existing video for Instagram with Filmora, follow these steps:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Touch New Project to begin a new filming session at the bottom of the screen.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Choose the video you want to speed up and hit <strong>Import</strong>. After the editor is opened, you may begin editing. In the toolbar at the very bottom of the screen, choose <strong>Trim</strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/trim-instagram-video-filmorago-android.jpg"                      alt="trim instagram video filmorago android"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> You may need to slide to the left to view and click the <strong>Speed</strong> button in the toolbar.

Does Instagram have a feature that allows users to know who unfollowed me on Instagram? Is this true? There is a method to do it! To find out, you’ll have to download an app.</p><p>More likes and followers are the two things that every Instagram influencer strives for. However, maintaining your present audience is just as critical. You could be thinking, Who unfollowed me on Instagram? as a result of this experience.

As a result, even if the number of Followers on YOUR profile drops, you will have no idea who unfollowed you.</p><p>There are several third-party Instagram unfollower tracker applications available right now. These are followers and unfollowers trackers for Instagram, so you can observe who no longer finds your posts interesting.</p><h2 id="Third-Party-Instagram-Apps-The-Problem"><a href="#Third-Party-Instagram-Apps-The-Problem" class="headerlink" title="Third-Party Instagram Apps: The Problem"></a>Third-Party Instagram Apps: The Problem</h2><p>While these applications make it simple to see who unfollowed me on Instagram? but they also have a number of drawbacks that should be considered before using them.

Does Instagram have a feature that allows users to know who unfollowed me on Instagram? Is this true? There is a method to do it! To find out, you’ll have to download an app.</p><p>More likes and followers are the two things that every Instagram influencer strives for. However, maintaining your present audience is just as critical. You could be thinking, Who unfollowed me on Instagram? as a result of this experience. As a result, you can know who unfollowed me on Instagram?</p><p>There is no official method to see who has unfollowed you on Instagram. As a result, even if the number of Followers on YOUR profile drops, you will have no idea who unfollowed you.</p><p>There are several third-party Instagram unfollower tracker applications available right now. These are followers and unfollowers trackers for Instagram, so you can observe who no longer finds your posts interesting.</p><h2 id="Third-Party-Instagram-Apps-The-Problem-3"><a href="#Third-Party-Instagram-Apps-The-Problem-3" class="headerlink" title="Third-Party Instagram Apps: The Problem"></a>Third-Party Instagram Apps: The Problem</h2><p>While these applications make it simple to see who unfollowed me on Instagram? but they also have a number of drawbacks that should be considered before using them. What can be done by unauthorized developers is heavily limited by Instagram’s API.</p><p>For example, with all these applications, you’ll only view data going back to when you originally installed the program. Every update to your accounts is tracked from the moment you set it up. However, if you lost any followers before downloading the program, you will not recover them.</p><h2 id="FollowMeter-The-Easiest-Best-App-for-Social-Media-3"><a href="#FollowMeter-The-Easiest-Best-App-for-Social-Media-3" class="headerlink" title="FollowMeter: The Easiest &amp; Best App for Social Media"></a>FollowMeter: The Easiest &amp; Best App for Social Media</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/followmeter-poster.png"                      alt="followmeter-poster"                ></p><p>Our favorite program for finding out who stopped following us was FollowMeter, which we tested out a number of times. Setting it up is simple, the user interface is straightforward, and the Unfollower option is absolutely free of charge. Because it only works after setup, you won’t be able to see who has unfollowed you in the past.</p><p>Users may see who has unfollowed them, who has followed them, who has followed you but has not followed them back, and who has followed you but has not returned the favor.
