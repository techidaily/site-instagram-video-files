Does Instagram have a feature that allows users to know who unfollowed me on Instagram? Is this true? There is a method to do it! To find out, you’ll have to download an app.</p><p>More likes and followers are the two things that every Instagram influencer strives for. However, maintaining your present audience is just as critical. You could be thinking, Who unfollowed me on Instagram? as a result of this experience. As a result, you can know who unfollowed me on Instagram?</p><p>There is no official method to see who has unfollowed you on Instagram. As a result, even if the number of Followers on YOUR profile drops, you will have no idea who unfollowed you.</p><p>There are several third-party Instagram unfollower tracker applications available right now. These are followers and unfollowers trackers for Instagram, so you can observe who no longer finds your posts interesting.</p><h2 id="Third-Party-Instagram-Apps-The-Problem"><a href="#Third-Party-Instagram-Apps-The-Problem" class="headerlink" title="Third-Party Instagram Apps: The Problem"></a>Third-Party Instagram Apps: The Problem</h2><p>While these applications make it simple to see who unfollowed me on Instagram? but they also have a number of drawbacks that should be considered before using them. What can be done by unauthorized developers is heavily limited by Instagram’s API.</p><p>For example, with all these applications, you’ll only view data going back to when you originally installed the program. Every update to your accounts is tracked from the moment you set it up. However, if you lost any followers before downloading the program, you will not recover them.</p><h2 id="FollowMeter-The-Easiest-Best-App-for-Social-Media"><a href="#FollowMeter-The-Easiest-Best-App-for-Social-Media" class="headerlink" title="FollowMeter: The Easiest &amp; Best App for Social Media"></a>FollowMeter: The Easiest &amp; Best App for Social Media</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/followmeter-poster.png"                      alt="followmeter-poster"                ></p><p>Our favorite program for finding out who stopped following us was FollowMeter, which we tested out a number of times.

Does Instagram have a feature that allows users to know who unfollowed me on Instagram? Is this true? There is a method to do it! To find out, you’ll have to download an app.</p><p>More likes and followers are the two things that every Instagram influencer strives for. However, maintaining your present audience is just as critical. You could be thinking, Who unfollowed me on Instagram? as a result of this experience. As a result, you can know who unfollowed me on Instagram?</p><p>There is no official method to see who has unfollowed you on Instagram. As a result, even if the number of Followers on YOUR profile drops, you will have no idea who unfollowed you.</p><p>There are several third-party Instagram unfollower tracker applications available right now. These are followers and unfollowers trackers for Instagram, so you can observe who no longer finds your posts interesting.</p><h2 id="Third-Party-Instagram-Apps-The-Problem-3"><a href="#Third-Party-Instagram-Apps-The-Problem-3" class="headerlink" title="Third-Party Instagram Apps: The Problem"></a>Third-Party Instagram Apps: The Problem</h2><p>While these applications make it simple to see who unfollowed me on Instagram? but they also have a number of drawbacks that should be considered before using them. What can be done by unauthorized developers is heavily limited by Instagram’s API.</p><p>For example, with all these applications, you’ll only view data going back to when you originally installed the program. Every update to your accounts is tracked from the moment you set it up. However, if you lost any followers before downloading the program, you will not recover them.</p><h2 id="FollowMeter-The-Easiest-Best-App-for-Social-Media-3"><a href="#FollowMeter-The-Easiest-Best-App-for-Social-Media-3" class="headerlink" title="FollowMeter: The Easiest &amp; Best App for Social Media"></a>FollowMeter: The Easiest &amp; Best App for Social Media</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/followmeter-poster.png"                      alt="followmeter-poster"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135353/19272" target="_top" id="2135353">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135353" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="180" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135353/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Our favorite program for finding out who stopped following us was FollowMeter, which we tested out a number of times.

It is a platform where people enjoy getting socially involved a lot.

Even today, recording a portrait video and showing it in any other context other than the Internet can be viewed as amateurish and embarrassing. However, the recently launched IGTV disregards all this, as it doesn’t allow its users to <strong>upload horizontal videos</strong> to its platform. What’s more, IGTV is rapidly growing in popularity, and the trend can be expected to continue in the foreseeable future. That’s why, in this article, we are going to show you <strong>three different ways of creating and sharing landscape videos on IGTV</strong>.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">IGTV Video Specs You Should Know Before Uploading a Video to Your Channel</a></li><li><a href="#part2">How to Upload a Landscape Video to IGTV from a Mac or a PC computer?</a></li></ul><h2 id="IGTV-Video-Specs-You-Should-Know-Before-Uploading-a-Video-to-Your-Channel"><a href="#IGTV-Video-Specs-You-Should-Know-Before-Uploading-a-Video-to-Your-Channel" class="headerlink" title="IGTV Video Specs You Should Know Before Uploading a Video to Your Channel"></a>IGTV Video Specs You Should Know Before Uploading a Video to Your Channel</h2><p>Instagram is famous for severely limiting the options its users have at their disposal because it only allowed them to post square-shaped photos for years. IGTV seems to be following the same pattern, not only because you can’t upload horizontally oriented videos, but also because your videos must be in <strong>MP4 format</strong>. Yes, that’s right, the platform currently doesn’t support any other video file format.</p><p>Even though you can now share videos that last up to ten minutes or an entire hour if you own a verified account, <strong>the platform also limits the maximum size of video files</strong> you can upload to your IGTV channel. <strong>A ten-minute video can’t be larger than 650MB</strong>, while the size of videos that last one hour can’t exceed <strong>3.6 GB</strong>. In addition, your IGTV videos can only have aspect ratios that range from <strong>4:5 up to 9:16</strong>. These specs make it easy to see why all the content you post on IGTV has to be created specifically for this platform.</p><p><strong>You may also like:</strong><br><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >What is IGTV and How to Use It: Everything You Need to Know&gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a><br><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >How to Download&#x2F;Save Instagram Photos&#x2F;Videos on iPhone&gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="How-to-Save-Instagram-photos-videos-on-iPhone"><a href="#How-to-Save-Instagram-photos-videos-on-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="How to Save Instagram photos&#x2F;videos on iPhone"></a>How to Save Instagram photos&#x2F;videos on iPhone</h2><h2 id="How-to-Upload-a-Landscape-Video-to-IGTV-from-a-Mac-or-a-PC-computer"><a href="#How-to-Upload-a-Landscape-Video-to-IGTV-from-a-Mac-or-a-PC-computer" class="headerlink" title="How to Upload a Landscape Video to IGTV from a Mac or a PC computer?"></a>How to Upload a Landscape Video to IGTV from a Mac or a PC computer?</h2><p>If you already have an Instagram account, you can upload your videos to IGTV directly from your computer. All you have to do is head over to <strong>Instagram.com</strong> and then click on the <strong>IGTV icon</strong> on your profile page. This means that you can use Mac and PC-based video editing software products to edit your videos before you share them on IGTV.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://bluettide.pxf.io/c/5597632/2141684/17092" target="_top" id="2141684">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17092-2141684" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="120" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://bluettide.pxf.io/i/5597632/2141684/17092"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Using-Filmora-Video-Editor-to-Edit-IGTV-Videos"><a href="#Using-Filmora-Video-Editor-to-Edit-IGTV-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Using Filmora Video Editor to Edit IGTV Videos"></a>Using Filmora Video Editor to Edit IGTV Videos</h3><p>If you decide to edit the videos you want to upload to IGTV on a Mac or a PC computer, then we suggest using the Filmora video editor, because it offers all the tools you’re going to need to create a landscape video you can share on your IGTV channel.</p><p>Check out our video guide about how to edit videos for Instagram.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                ></a><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                ></a></p><p>Here is the process in word format in case you don’t have time to check the video.</p><p><strong>Create a new project</strong>, and then when the new project loads head over the <strong>File menu</strong> and choose the <strong>Project Settings</strong> option. Click on the <strong>Resolution drop-down menu</strong> and then select the <strong>720x1280 (9:16)</strong> option. Make sure to change <strong>the Frame Rate to 30FPS</strong> and click <strong>OK</strong> to confirm the changes you made.</p><p>Import the video you’d like to edit into Filmora by either dragging it from a folder on your computer and dropping it to the <strong>Media panel</strong>, or by clicking on the <strong>Import drop-down menu</strong> and selecting the <strong>Import Media Files</strong> option. Once you’ve imported the video file into the editor, you should place it on the timeline.</p><p>Head back to the <strong>File menu</strong>, and click on the <strong>Preferences</strong> option, or use the <strong>CTRL+Shit+,</strong> keyboard shortcut to bring up the <strong>Preferences window</strong>. Click on the <strong>Editing tab</strong> and select the <strong>Crop to Fit</strong> option from the <strong>Photo Placement drop-down menu</strong>.</p><p>You can then cut the video, change its duration or enhance its colors, before heading over to the <strong>Effects tab</strong>. The <strong>Filters menu</strong> contains the <strong>Background Blur folder</strong>, so you should just click on it and select the Background Blur you like the most. By doing so, you will cover the black areas of the video and make it more aesthetically pleasing.</p><p>Optionally, you can <strong>take a snapshot of your video</strong> by clicking on the <strong>Photo Camera icon</strong> located below the <strong>Preview Window</strong> in order to create a cover photo for your IGTV video. When done, you should click on the Export button, make sure to <strong>change the output format to MP4</strong>, and wait for the rendering process to be completed.</p><p>Once your video is exported from Filmora, you should go to Instagram.com, click on the IGTV icon on your profile page and upload the horizontal video to your IGTV channel.</p><h2 id="Using-the-Instagram-App-to-Upload-Horizontal-Videos-to-IGTV-from-Smartphones"><a href="#Using-the-Instagram-App-to-Upload-Horizontal-Videos-to-IGTV-from-Smartphones" class="headerlink" title="Using the Instagram App to Upload Horizontal Videos to IGTV from Smartphones"></a>Using the Instagram App to Upload Horizontal Videos to IGTV from Smartphones</h2><p>In case you’d just like to post a video to your IGTV channel, you can use the Instagram app to quickly create a horizontally oriented video. <strong>The stories editor</strong> enables you to accomplish this, but you should keep in mind that this solution only works if the duration of a video doesn’t exceed the <strong>15-second limit</strong>.</p><p>So once you launch the Instagram app, you should <strong>open the story editor</strong> and then tap on the <strong>Add button</strong>. This will enable you to select the video you’d like to edit.</p><p>After you’ve selected the video you’ll be able to see <strong>two arrows on the screen</strong>. <strong>Use your fingers to rotate the video</strong> and change its orientation from vertical to horizontal. Your video should occupy the <strong>middle of the screen</strong>, while the areas above and below the video should be blurred.</p><p>Tap on the <strong>Save icon</strong> to confirm the changes and proceed to upload the video to your IGTV channel.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2049378/7443" target="_top" id="2049378">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2049378" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2049378/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Creating-a-Horizontal-Video-from-a-Mobile-Device-with-GoPro-Splice"><a href="#Creating-a-Horizontal-Video-from-a-Mobile-Device-with-GoPro-Splice" class="headerlink" title="Creating a Horizontal Video from a Mobile Device with GoPro Splice"></a>Creating a Horizontal Video from a Mobile Device with GoPro Splice</h2><p>iPhone users can easily create landscape videos for their IGTV channels with GoPro’s <a class="link"   href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/splice-video-editor-maker/id409838725?mt=8" >Splice <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> app. You can <strong>download the app for free from the App Store</strong> and you won’t have to make any in-app purchases after you install Splice on your device.</p><p>Keep in mind that it is better to complete all other editing tasks before you start reformatting your video. Simply <strong>create a new project</strong>, select the video you’d like to share on your IGTV channel, and tap on <strong>the Add button</strong>. A new window will load, where you will be asked if you want to add music to your video, so if your video already has a soundtrack you can skip this step.</p><p>The app will then take you to the <strong>Project Settings</strong> window and you should just tap on the <strong>Format option</strong> and change it from <strong>Portrait to Landscape</strong>. Optionally, you can <strong>switch off the Outro option</strong> that is enabled by default or you can change the background color. Tap on the <strong>Done button</strong>, when ready, and proceed to export your video. Even though Splice offers the option to export videos directly to Instagram, you won’t be able to upload the video to your IGTV channel. So just save the video to your camera roll, and use the Instagram or IGTV app to upload the file to IGTV.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>None of the options for creating vertical videos for IGTV are perfect because each of them leaves portions of the frame empty. Basically, you will be creating a vertically oriented frame with a 9:16 aspect ratio, that contains a centrally positioned and horizontally oriented video. This is only a good option if the video you want to upload to IGTV doesn’t make any sense when it is vertically oriented, which can be the case more often than you’d expect.

However, the recently launched IGTV disregards all this, as it doesn’t allow its users to <strong>upload horizontal videos</strong> to its platform. What’s more, IGTV is rapidly growing in popularity, and the trend can be expected to continue in the foreseeable future.

Yes, that’s right, the platform currently doesn’t support any other video file format.</p><p>Even though you can now share videos that last up to ten minutes or an entire hour if you own a verified account, <strong>the platform also limits the maximum size of video files</strong> you can upload to your IGTV channel. <strong>A ten-minute video can’t be larger than 650MB</strong>, while the size of videos that last one hour can’t exceed <strong>3.6 GB</strong>. In addition, your IGTV videos can only have aspect ratios that range from <strong>4:5 up to 9:16</strong>.

These specs make it easy to see why all the content you post on IGTV has to be created specifically for this platform.</p><p><strong>You may also like:</strong><br><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >What is IGTV and How to Use It: Everything You Need to Know&gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a><br><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >How to Download&#x2F;Save Instagram Photos&#x2F;Videos on iPhone&gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="How-to-Save-Instagram-photos-videos-on-iPhone-3"><a href="#How-to-Save-Instagram-photos-videos-on-iPhone-3" class="headerlink" title="How to Save Instagram photos&#x2F;videos on iPhone"></a>How to Save Instagram photos&#x2F;videos on iPhone</h2><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1902324/19272" target="_top" id="1902324">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1902324" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1902324/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-to-Upload-a-Landscape-Video-to-IGTV-from-a-Mac-or-a-PC-computer-3"><a href="#How-to-Upload-a-Landscape-Video-to-IGTV-from-a-Mac-or-a-PC-computer-3" class="headerlink" title="How to Upload a Landscape Video to IGTV from a Mac or a PC computer?"></a>How to Upload a Landscape Video to IGTV from a Mac or a PC computer?</h2><p>If you already have an Instagram account, you can upload your videos to IGTV directly from your computer.

Click on the <strong>Resolution drop-down menu</strong> and then select the <strong>720x1280 (9:16)</strong> option. Make sure to change <strong>the Frame Rate to 30FPS</strong> and click <strong>OK</strong> to confirm the changes you made.</p><p>Import the video you’d like to edit into Filmora by either dragging it from a folder on your computer and dropping it to the <strong>Media panel</strong>, or by clicking on the <strong>Import drop-down menu</strong> and selecting the <strong>Import Media Files</strong> option. Once you’ve imported the video file into the editor, you should place it on the timeline.</p><p>Head back to the <strong>File menu</strong>, and click on the <strong>Preferences</strong> option, or use the <strong>CTRL+Shit+,</strong> keyboard shortcut to bring up the <strong>Preferences window</strong>. Click on the <strong>Editing tab</strong> and select the <strong>Crop to Fit</strong> option from the <strong>Photo Placement drop-down menu</strong>.</p><p>You can then cut the video, change its duration or enhance its colors, before heading over to the <strong>Effects tab</strong>. The <strong>Filters menu</strong> contains the <strong>Background Blur folder</strong>, so you should just click on it and select the Background Blur you like the most. By doing so, you will cover the black areas of the video and make it more aesthetically pleasing.</p><p>Optionally, you can <strong>take a snapshot of your video</strong> by clicking on the <strong>Photo Camera icon</strong> located below the <strong>Preview Window</strong> in order to create a cover photo for your IGTV video. When done, you should click on the Export button, make sure to <strong>change the output format to MP4</strong>, and wait for the rendering process to be completed.</p><p>Once your video is exported from Filmora, you should go to Instagram.com, click on the IGTV icon on your profile page and upload the horizontal video to your IGTV channel.</p><h2 id="Using-the-Instagram-App-to-Upload-Horizontal-Videos-to-IGTV-from-Smartphones-3"><a href="#Using-the-Instagram-App-to-Upload-Horizontal-Videos-to-IGTV-from-Smartphones-3" class="headerlink" title="Using the Instagram App to Upload Horizontal Videos to IGTV from Smartphones"></a>Using the Instagram App to Upload Horizontal Videos to IGTV from Smartphones</h2><p>In case you’d just like to post a video to your IGTV channel, you can use the Instagram app to quickly create a horizontally oriented video. <strong>The stories editor</strong> enables you to accomplish this, but you should keep in mind that this solution only works if the duration of a video doesn’t exceed the <strong>15-second limit</strong>.</p><p>So once you launch the Instagram app, you should <strong>open the story editor</strong> and then tap on the <strong>Add button</strong>. This will enable you to select the video you’d like to edit.</p><p>After you’ve selected the video you’ll be able to see <strong>two arrows on the screen</strong>. <strong>Use your fingers to rotate the video</strong> and change its orientation from vertical to horizontal. Your video should occupy the <strong>middle of the screen</strong>, while the areas above and below the video should be blurred.</p><p>Tap on the <strong>Save icon</strong> to confirm the changes and proceed to upload the video to your IGTV channel.</p><h2 id="Creating-a-Horizontal-Video-from-a-Mobile-Device-with-GoPro-Splice-3"><a href="#Creating-a-Horizontal-Video-from-a-Mobile-Device-with-GoPro-Splice-3" class="headerlink" title="Creating a Horizontal Video from a Mobile Device with GoPro Splice"></a>Creating a Horizontal Video from a Mobile Device with GoPro Splice</h2><p>iPhone users can easily create landscape videos for their IGTV channels with GoPro’s <a class="link"   href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/splice-video-editor-maker/id409838725?mt=8" >Splice <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> app. You can <strong>download the app for free from the App Store</strong> and you won’t have to make any in-app purchases after you install Splice on your device.</p><p>Keep in mind that it is better to complete all other editing tasks before you start reformatting your video. Simply <strong>create a new project</strong>, select the video you’d like to share on your IGTV channel, and tap on <strong>the Add button</strong>. A new window will load, where you will be asked if you want to add music to your video, so if your video already has a soundtrack you can skip this step.</p><p>The app will then take you to the <strong>Project Settings</strong> window and you should just tap on the <strong>Format option</strong> and change it from <strong>Portrait to Landscape</strong>. Optionally, you can <strong>switch off the Outro option</strong> that is enabled by default or you can change the background color. Tap on the <strong>Done button</strong>, when ready, and proceed to export your video. Even though Splice offers the option to export videos directly to Instagram, you won’t be able to upload the video to your IGTV channel. So just save the video to your camera roll, and use the Instagram or IGTV app to upload the file to IGTV.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>None of the options for creating vertical videos for IGTV are perfect because each of them leaves portions of the frame empty. Basically, you will be creating a vertically oriented frame with a 9:16 aspect ratio, that contains a centrally positioned and horizontally oriented video. This is only a good option if the video you want to upload to IGTV doesn’t make any sense when it is vertically oriented, which can be the case more often than you’d expect.

Open the video editor in the <strong>Full Feature Mode</strong>, and then click on the Import drop-down menu and select the Import Media Files option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-import.jpg"                                     ></p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                ></a><a class="link"   href="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg" >Download Mac Version <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>](<a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p><strong>Step 2: Drag and Drop the video file onto the Timeline</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/video-editor-main-interface-1.jpg"                                     ></p><p>Now that the video clip you want to edit is in the editor’s media library, drag it and drop it to the timeline.</p><p><strong>Step 3: Crop videos for Instagram</strong></p><p><strong>1. Landscape (16:9)</strong></p><p>Chances are that the camera you used to record your video clip recorded the footage in the landscape aspect ratio. Before you can export your video clip, you must first check the resolution and frame rate of the clip you want to export. Right-click on the clip in the media panel and select Properties. After you found out this information, click on the Export button located just below the media panel.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/check-aspect-ratio.jpg"                      alt="check aspect ratio"                ></p><p>Once the new window appears, you should click on the Format icon positioned in the upper left corner of the screen. Select the MP4 format, name your file and select the folder where the file will be exported.</p><p>Click on the Settings button and then set the Quality of the video to Best and select the HD Optimized option in the Encoder menu. Choose the Resolution and Frame Rate that match the ones in your video and change the Bitrate in the Audio settings to 128 Kbps and hit OK.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/16-9-aspect-ratio-export.jpg"                                     ></p><p><strong>2. Portrait (4:3)</strong></p><p>In order to create a video that has a portrait aspect ratio, you need to crop it. You can do this by clicking on the <strong>Crop and Pan tool</strong>, located in the timeline tools. Use an <a class="link"   href="https://calculateaspectratio.com/" >online aspect ratio calculator <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to find the exact resolution that matches the portrait aspect ratio.

Insert the numbers manually to resize the video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/crop-and-zoom-filmora.jpg"                      alt="crop and zoom filmora"                ></p><p>Adjust the crop tool’s position and click OK. The export process for landscape and portrait videos is nearly identical and the only thing you need to change is the resolution. Click on the Resolution drop-down menu and select the custom option and then enter the height and weight values you inserted in the cropping tool. Your portrait video is ready to be exported.</p><p><strong>3. Square (1:1)</strong></p><p>The process of creating a square video is the same as the process of creating a portrait video, but height and weight values need to be identical, so you’ll want to set them to 1080X1080, for example. Adjust the position of the crop rectangle and click OK.</p><p>The steps for exporting square videos are the same as the steps you need to take to export a portrait video. Make sure to change the resolution of the video to 1080X1080 before hitting the Export button and enjoy sharing your videos on Instagram.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-AIMmjowaFs4/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABc/Y5UmwDaI7HU/s250-c-k/photo.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Liza Brown</p><p>Liza Brown is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Liza Brown</p><h5 id="Liza-Brown-1"><a href="#Liza-Brown-1" class="headerlink" title="Liza Brown"></a>Liza Brown</h5><p> Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions</p><p>With more than 500 million active daily users Instagram has become one of the largest photo and video sharing platforms in the world.

Click on the Resolution drop-down menu and select the custom option and then enter the height and weight values you inserted in the cropping tool. Your portrait video is ready to be exported.</p><p><strong>3. Square (1:1)</strong></p><p>The process of creating a square video is the same as the process of creating a portrait video, but height and weight values need to be identical, so you’ll want to set them to 1080X1080, for example. Adjust the position of the crop rectangle and click OK.</p><p>The steps for exporting square videos are the same as the steps you need to take to export a portrait video.

One of the best ways to do that is by using a reliable <strong>Instagram grid maker</strong>. For instance, with an Instagram grid planner, you can come up with an overall theme for your profile or connect various posts via a puzzle. To help you elevate the creative and visual appeal of your profile, I’m going to make you familiar with the 10 best grid makers for Instagram.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: What are Instagram Grids All About?</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 2: The 6 Best Online Grid Makers for Instagram</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Part 3: Top 4 Grid Makers for Instagram [for Android and iOS]</a></li><li><a href="#part4">Part 4: How to Make an Appealing Photo Grid on Instagram?</a></li><li><a href="#part5">Part 5: Creative Ideas to Implement Instagram Grid Layouts</a></li></ul><h2 id="Part-1-What-are-Instagram-Grids-All-About"><a href="#Part-1-What-are-Instagram-Grids-All-About" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What are Instagram Grids All About?"></a>Part 1: What are Instagram Grids All About?</h2><p>You might already know that Instagram displays our posts in a 3-column layout. Therefore, to make the most of this layout, a lot of people work on the overall 3x3 grid (3 rows and 3 columns).</p><p>To catch the attention of their audience, you can come up with an overall theme for your profile using 9 posts (a 3x3 grid). For instance, you can see here is a perfect example of a puzzle grid in which some parts of a post are overlapping on the adjacent posts. This would make the overall profile look uniform and more aesthetically pleasing.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/what-are-instagram-grids.jpg"                      alt="what are instagram grids"                ></p><p>Just like this, there can be so many ways in which we can plan the layout of a grid for our Instagram profile.</p><h2 id="Part-2-The-6-Best-Online-Grid-Makers-for-Instagram"><a href="#Part-2-The-6-Best-Online-Grid-Makers-for-Instagram" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: The 6 Best Online Grid Makers for Instagram"></a>Part 2: The 6 Best Online Grid Makers for Instagram</h2><p>In case you are also looking for an online Instagram grid maker, then you can simply explore these options:</p><h4 id="1-My-Social-Boutique"><a href="#1-My-Social-Boutique" class="headerlink" title="1.My Social Boutique"></a>1.<a class="link"   href="https://mysocialboutique.co/" >My Social Boutique <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>If you are looking for free or paid Instagram grid templates, then you can head to My Social Boutique.

This will open a dedicated Instagram grid maker online tool.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/upload-image-splitter.jpg"                      alt="upload image splitter"                ></p><p>You can now just drag and drop an image that you want to split or click on the “Upload” button to browse and load it from your computer.</p><p><strong>Step 2: Choose how you want to split the image</strong></p><p>Great! Once the image has been loaded, you can simply check its preview on the side. Now, you can just crop the part of the image that you want to split from here. On the side, you can just enter the number of rows and columns in which you want to split the image. For instance, to get a 3x3 Instagram grid layout, you can set the number of columns and rows as 3.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/choose-how-split-image.jpg"                      alt="choose how split image"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3: Split your image and save all photos</strong></p><p>After setting a preferred ratio for the grid, you can also select a respective image format to export your files (like JPG or PNG). In the end, just click on the “Split Image” button and wait as the application would split your photos in a specific ratio.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/split-image-save-photo.jpg"                      alt="split image save photo"                ></p><p>When the process is completed, the online grid maker for Instagram will let you know.

You can use either of these Instagram grid makers online or app solutions to meet your requirements. Out of them, let’s consider the example of Image Splitter by Postcron to make a grid for your Instagram account.</p><p>Since Image Splitter is a free online Instagram grid planner, it will let you come up with stunning grids for your account on the go. To use this free photo grid Instagram tool, just go through these steps:</p><p><strong>Step 1: Upload the image you want to split</strong></p><p>At first, you can just go to the official website of Image Splitter by Postcron and click on the “Upload Image” button from its home. This will open a dedicated Instagram grid maker online tool.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/upload-image-splitter.jpg"                      alt="upload image splitter"                ></p><p>You can now just drag and drop an image that you want to split or click on the “Upload” button to browse and load it from your computer.</p><p><strong>Step 2: Choose how you want to split the image</strong></p><p>Great! Once the image has been loaded, you can simply check its preview on the side. Now, you can just crop the part of the image that you want to split from here. On the side, you can just enter the number of rows and columns in which you want to split the image. For instance, to get a 3x3 Instagram grid layout, you can set the number of columns and rows as 3.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/choose-how-split-image.jpg"                      alt="choose how split image"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3: Split your image and save all photos</strong></p><p>After setting a preferred ratio for the grid, you can also select a respective image format to export your files (like JPG or PNG). In the end, just click on the “Split Image” button and wait as the application would split your photos in a specific ratio.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/split-image-save-photo.jpg"                      alt="split image save photo"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2144308/7443" target="_top" id="2144308">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2144308" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2144308/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>When the process is completed, the online grid maker for Instagram will let you know.

The main point here is, one needs to have a verified account by Instagram or a <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >business profil <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> with at least 10000 followers.

Future updates might support sharing links on Instagram Stories for all.</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong> – Take a shot or record a video using the Instagram Stories camera or select a recently (within 24 hours) clicked photo by swiping the screen up.</p><p><strong>Step 2</strong> – Now, tap the chain icon from the top right corner of the screen and enter the desired URL. Select the tick mark on the top right corner of the Instagram Story window.</p><p><strong>Step 3</strong> – Once the URL is incorporated, enjoy editing your Story with filters, stickers, text and then tap ‘Next’. It is important to add a call to action here. So, you can mention ‘Swipe up to know more’, ‘See more’, ‘Explore’ etc. to guide the users.</p><h3 id="Section-2-Add-a-link-to-main-post"><a href="#Section-2-Add-a-link-to-main-post" class="headerlink" title="Section 2: Add a link to main post"></a>Section 2: Add a link to main post</h3><p> You can add a link to your Instagram post, but the only restraint is, it’s not clickable.
