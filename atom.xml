When your audience is looking to gain more information about your business they want to find this information with ease.</p><p>Naming your Instagram Highlight must be done strategically so that users can find what they are looking for without any guesswork.

The better curated your Highlights, the more your audience can understand who you are and what you do or sell.</p><h3 id="1-Organize-and-Categorize-Your-Highlights-Strategically-3"><a href="#1-Organize-and-Categorize-Your-Highlights-Strategically-3" class="headerlink" title="1.

When your audience is looking to gain more information about your business they want to find this information with ease.</p><p>Naming your Instagram Highlight must be done strategically so that users can find what they are looking for without any guesswork.

In fact, once you know what you’re doing, you’ll be able to crank every single visual you post into top gear, with just a few taps here and there. Here are some top tips on how to edit Instagram photos to help you post like a true pro.</p><ul><li><strong>Take a great photo to begin with</strong></li></ul><p> It’s a bit of a no-brainer, but if your photograph sucks from the get-go, none of the Instagram photo editor apps will fix your mess for you. Take heed of our photography tips and begin with an awesome shot before you’ve even started to fiddle with the software.</p><ul><li><strong>Upload like a pro</strong></li></ul><p> Hopefully you’re comfortable with uploading images to Instagram, but if you’re still in the dark, here’s how to do it. Open the Instagram app on your device and click the plus sign to upload an image. You’ll find this in the bottom of your screen front and centre. From here, simply click the photo you’d like to upload from your camera roll.</p><p> When you upload, Instagram automatically crops your image to their signature square format. However, if you haven’t decided how you want to crop your photo or would prefer it at its original width, you can simply click the expand icon in the left corner to take it back to full size. You can upload one image, or up to 10 photos at once, so don’t be shy!</p><ul><li><strong>Select your filter</strong></li></ul><p> Now you can start to really have some fun! The built in Instagram photo editor app is a pretty powerful little tool, and there’s loads of tweaks and edits you can make to step your photo sharing up a notch. The first thing to do is choose one of the many awesome filters which are built into the Instagram app.</p><p> There’s no hard and fast rule about which filter looks best; it really comes down to personal taste. However, it’s worth thinking about what you want to achieve, and go for a filter that creates the right type of atmosphere for your scene. Here are some of the most popular Instagram filters, and how each one will change your image:</p><ul><li><strong>X Pro II:</strong> One of our favorites, this one sharpens, adds contrast and a vignette edge, to give photos a dramatic, professional effect. This one is a particularly good choice for modern photos of people</li><li><strong>Moon:</strong> If you love black and white photography, this filter is a great choice. Shadows are more intense, highlights seem to pop and the soft focusing gives a nicely aged look to the images.</li><li><strong>Lo-Fi:</strong> Another favorite over here, Lo-Fi saturates your image with rich colors and darkens all the shadows to add drama and intrigue.</li><li><strong>Hefe:</strong> If you love the vintage look, Hefe will be a great choice.

Well, let us welcome you to the world of better photos.</p><p> When you’re still on the filter selection screen, do you see that little sunshine-like symbol at the top? Hit that, and then fiddle with the slider to add more of less lux to your image.

Slide up for more or down for less and learn to love the lux touch!</p><ul><li><strong>Do some basic editing</strong></li></ul><p> Within the Instagram photo editor app, aside of the filters there are also some tools for the most basic of manual image editing. It’s well worth becoming adept at these, because on your quest to discover how to edit Instagram photos like a pro, these handy functions really do separate the men from the boys. Here’s how they work:</p><ul><li><strong>Adjust:</strong> Also know as the ‘straighten my shot’ tool this is crucial if, like so many of us, you’re incapable of taking a photo completely straight. Find something perfectly horizontal or vertical, and line it up with the handy guides within the tool.</li><li><strong>Brightness:</strong> Shots a bit shady? This can add a touch of sunlight and brightness to any image, very useful for those taken in poor lighting or at night.</li><li><strong>Contrast:</strong> When everything is somewhat wishy-washy, contrast will adjust the difference in light balance to add more variation between light and shadow. Alternatively, if your image is a bit over exposed, less contrast can tone things down a bit.</li><li><strong>Structure:</strong> When you want to pick out those little details, structure will help add texture to your image. Great for landscapes and nature photos but not so great on portraits.</li><li><strong>Warmth:</strong> Adjusting the tones on your images can make things more dramatic, friendlier, or more edgy. Sliding the tool to the right will add sepia and orange tones, perfect for a sunset or holiday shot, whereas to the left will make things cooler and more blue-ish.</li><li><strong>Saturation:</strong> Adjusting the saturation can make the colors in your photos more vibrant but be cautious in its use as it can make photos look totally over-edited. Slide the adjuster completely to the left to turn your image black and white.</li><li><strong>Fade:</strong> As you might guess, fade makes your picture look faded. It’s great for manually adding a vintage feel to your photos if the built-in filters just aren’t doing it for you.</li><li><strong>Highlights:</strong> Make whites whiter and brights brighter by adjusting this setting up or move it down to tone down highlights that are just too poppy.</li><li><strong>Shadow:</strong> As the alter-ego to highlights, you can already guess what this tool does. Use it to add drama by darkening shadows in your image, or make previously unseen details reappear by reducing the depth of the dark areas.</li><li><strong>Color:</strong> Add a tint to your photos of your choice of color and choose whether to apply it to the shadows or highlights of the image.</li><li><strong>Vignette:</strong> Love the attention focusing abilities of dark edges around your subject? Vignette adds this automatically, and you can adjust the intensity of this effect with ease.</li><li><strong>Tilt shift:</strong> If you want something in the foreground in focus and everything else out of focus, this is the tool that imitates what only the most expensive cameras can do. Choose a circular shift to pick out a particular object, or a linear shift to focus everything at a certain depth in the photo.</li><li><strong>Sharpen:</strong> To make your images super clear, sharpen is a great tool. Unlike Structure it doesn’t add extra detail, it simply enhances the details that were already there for a clearer, more professional image.</li></ul><p> Once you’ve finished editing your image, you’re all ready to post it. Don’t forget to make the most of hashtags and an interesting caption to help other users find your photos and consider tagging your location to get even more likes and followers.</p><p> So now you know how to edit Instagram photos on the Instagram photo editor app. You don’t always have to post your photos to Instagram either. Simply turn on your airplane mode and the app will allow you to save your photos locally, letting you make use of all the funky tools available without having to share your images directly.</p><p> Do remember that Instagram images are 1080 x 1080 pixels when they are uploaded. You might not realise this as they are certainly a lot smaller when you view them. Instagram itself resizes each image to 612 x 612 pixels, but when it’s displayed in a user’s feed, it’s even smaller again, at just 510 x 510.</p><p> What this means for you is that, although the picture displayed is small, any distortion caused by expansion of a small image in the first place will be replicated even at smaller sizes. When it comes to insta-worthy images, quality is king, so never be tempted to share anything that is any less than 1080 x 1080 pixels. If you’ve got smaller pictures that you are itching to share, do so via other social media platforms.</p><p> How is your Instagram photo editing going?

From here, simply click the photo you’d like to upload from your camera roll.</p><p> When you upload, Instagram automatically crops your image to their signature square format. However, if you haven’t decided how you want to crop your photo or would prefer it at its original width, you can simply click the expand icon in the left corner to take it back to full size.

However, it’s worth thinking about what you want to achieve, and go for a filter that creates the right type of atmosphere for your scene. Here are some of the most popular Instagram filters, and how each one will change your image:</p><ul><li><strong>X Pro II:</strong> One of our favorites, this one sharpens, adds contrast and a vignette edge, to give photos a dramatic, professional effect. This one is a particularly good choice for modern photos of people</li><li><strong>Moon:</strong> If you love black and white photography, this filter is a great choice. Shadows are more intense, highlights seem to pop and the soft focusing gives a nicely aged look to the images.</li><li><strong>Lo-Fi:</strong> Another favorite over here, Lo-Fi saturates your image with rich colors and darkens all the shadows to add drama and intrigue.</li><li><strong>Hefe:</strong> If you love the vintage look, Hefe will be a great choice.

It’s well worth becoming adept at these, because on your quest to discover how to edit Instagram photos like a pro, these handy functions really do separate the men from the boys. Here’s how they work:</p><ul><li><strong>Adjust:</strong> Also know as the ‘straighten my shot’ tool this is crucial if, like so many of us, you’re incapable of taking a photo completely straight. Find something perfectly horizontal or vertical, and line it up with the handy guides within the tool.</li><li><strong>Brightness:</strong> Shots a bit shady? This can add a touch of sunlight and brightness to any image, very useful for those taken in poor lighting or at night.</li><li><strong>Contrast:</strong> When everything is somewhat wishy-washy, contrast will adjust the difference in light balance to add more variation between light and shadow. Alternatively, if your image is a bit over exposed, less contrast can tone things down a bit.</li><li><strong>Structure:</strong> When you want to pick out those little details, structure will help add texture to your image. Great for landscapes and nature photos but not so great on portraits.</li><li><strong>Warmth:</strong> Adjusting the tones on your images can make things more dramatic, friendlier, or more edgy. Sliding the tool to the right will add sepia and orange tones, perfect for a sunset or holiday shot, whereas to the left will make things cooler and more blue-ish.</li><li><strong>Saturation:</strong> Adjusting the saturation can make the colors in your photos more vibrant but be cautious in its use as it can make photos look totally over-edited. Slide the adjuster completely to the left to turn your image black and white.</li><li><strong>Fade:</strong> As you might guess, fade makes your picture look faded. It’s great for manually adding a vintage feel to your photos if the built-in filters just aren’t doing it for you.</li><li><strong>Highlights:</strong> Make whites whiter and brights brighter by adjusting this setting up or move it down to tone down highlights that are just too poppy.</li><li><strong>Shadow:</strong> As the alter-ego to highlights, you can already guess what this tool does. Use it to add drama by darkening shadows in your image, or make previously unseen details reappear by reducing the depth of the dark areas.</li><li><strong>Color:</strong> Add a tint to your photos of your choice of color and choose whether to apply it to the shadows or highlights of the image.</li><li><strong>Vignette:</strong> Love the attention focusing abilities of dark edges around your subject? Vignette adds this automatically, and you can adjust the intensity of this effect with ease.</li><li><strong>Tilt shift:</strong> If you want something in the foreground in focus and everything else out of focus, this is the tool that imitates what only the most expensive cameras can do. Choose a circular shift to pick out a particular object, or a linear shift to focus everything at a certain depth in the photo.</li><li><strong>Sharpen:</strong> To make your images super clear, sharpen is a great tool. Unlike Structure it doesn’t add extra detail, it simply enhances the details that were already there for a clearer, more professional image.</li></ul><p> Once you’ve finished editing your image, you’re all ready to post it. Don’t forget to make the most of hashtags and an interesting caption to help other users find your photos and consider tagging your location to get even more likes and followers.</p><p> So now you know how to edit Instagram photos on the Instagram photo editor app. You don’t always have to post your photos to Instagram either. Simply turn on your airplane mode and the app will allow you to save your photos locally, letting you make use of all the funky tools available without having to share your images directly.</p><p> Do remember that Instagram images are 1080 x 1080 pixels when they are uploaded. You might not realise this as they are certainly a lot smaller when you view them. Instagram itself resizes each image to 612 x 612 pixels, but when it’s displayed in a user’s feed, it’s even smaller again, at just 510 x 510.</p><p> What this means for you is that, although the picture displayed is small, any distortion caused by expansion of a small image in the first place will be replicated even at smaller sizes. When it comes to insta-worthy images, quality is king, so never be tempted to share anything that is any less than 1080 x 1080 pixels. If you’ve got smaller pictures that you are itching to share, do so via other social media platforms.</p><p> How is your Instagram photo editing going?

In fact, once you know what you’re doing, you’ll be able to crank every single visual you post into top gear, with just a few taps here and there. Here are some top tips on how to edit Instagram photos to help you post like a true pro.</p><ul><li><strong>Take a great photo to begin with</strong></li></ul><p> It’s a bit of a no-brainer, but if your photograph sucks from the get-go, none of the Instagram photo editor apps will fix your mess for you. Take heed of our photography tips and begin with an awesome shot before you’ve even started to fiddle with the software.</p><ul><li><strong>Upload like a pro</strong></li></ul><p> Hopefully you’re comfortable with uploading images to Instagram, but if you’re still in the dark, here’s how to do it. Open the Instagram app on your device and click the plus sign to upload an image. You’ll find this in the bottom of your screen front and centre. From here, simply click the photo you’d like to upload from your camera roll.</p><p> When you upload, Instagram automatically crops your image to their signature square format. However, if you haven’t decided how you want to crop your photo or would prefer it at its original width, you can simply click the expand icon in the left corner to take it back to full size. You can upload one image, or up to 10 photos at once, so don’t be shy!</p><ul><li><strong>Select your filter</strong></li></ul><p> Now you can start to really have some fun! The built in Instagram photo editor app is a pretty powerful little tool, and there’s loads of tweaks and edits you can make to step your photo sharing up a notch. The first thing to do is choose one of the many awesome filters which are built into the Instagram app.</p><p> There’s no hard and fast rule about which filter looks best; it really comes down to personal taste. However, it’s worth thinking about what you want to achieve, and go for a filter that creates the right type of atmosphere for your scene. Here are some of the most popular Instagram filters, and how each one will change your image:</p><ul><li><strong>X Pro II:</strong> One of our favorites, this one sharpens, adds contrast and a vignette edge, to give photos a dramatic, professional effect. This one is a particularly good choice for modern photos of people</li><li><strong>Moon:</strong> If you love black and white photography, this filter is a great choice. Shadows are more intense, highlights seem to pop and the soft focusing gives a nicely aged look to the images.</li><li><strong>Lo-Fi:</strong> Another favorite over here, Lo-Fi saturates your image with rich colors and darkens all the shadows to add drama and intrigue.</li><li><strong>Hefe:</strong> If you love the vintage look, Hefe will be a great choice. It adds a yellow tone and darker border for an edgy, aged appearance to your shots.</li><li><strong>Valencia:</strong> Hefe not aged enough for you? Try out Valencia. The addition of warm tones and faded colors will give your images an antique look, perfect for Insta-greatness.</li></ul><p> There are plenty of other filters to play with, so have a tinker and see which ones you like best. You may find that different filters suit different types of shots, or that you prefer to use the same one or two to give your Instagram feed a uniform style that is all your own.</p><p> To help you refine your photos with the same filters regularly, you can reorder the filter options on the Instagram photo editor app itself. Simply press and hold the three grey lines on the filter you want to move, then slide it into the position you wish. You can also hide filters entirely from the ‘manage’ functions of the menu, so that you don’t keep being offered a filter you really don’t like.</p><ul><li><strong>Add a touch of lux</strong></li></ul><p> Have you ever noticed the lux function on Instagram? If you want to know how to edit Instagram photos like a pro, then this is one feature you really need to get to know intimately. It’s super easy to use, but perhaps you’ve never found it. Well, let us welcome you to the world of better photos.</p><p> When you’re still on the filter selection screen, do you see that little sunshine-like symbol at the top? Hit that, and then fiddle with the slider to add more of less lux to your image. This tool automatically tweaks the saturation and contrast, adding vibrancy to your photos and highlighting the small details that make a good photo great. Slide up for more or down for less and learn to love the lux touch!</p><ul><li><strong>Do some basic editing</strong></li></ul><p> Within the Instagram photo editor app, aside of the filters there are also some tools for the most basic of manual image editing.

Adding Instagram video border has never been easier!</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://instagram-video-files.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-boost-your-igtv-views-top-5-tactics-for-increased-engagement/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Boost Your IGTV Views Top 5 Tactics for Increased Engagement</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-files.techidaily.com/new-how-to-craft-contagious-instagram-visuals-for-2024/"><u>[New] How to Craft Contagious Instagram Visuals for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-files.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-building-brand-presence-a-guide-to-planning-instagram-videos/"><u>[New] In 2024, Building Brand Presence A Guide to Planning Instagram Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-files.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-maximizing-marketing-the-best-highlight-techniques-for-brands/"><u>[New] In 2024, Maximizing Marketing The Best Highlight Techniques for Brands</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-files.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-mastering-instagram-videos-direct-and-alternative-saves/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Mastering Instagram Videos Direct & Alternative Saves</u></a></li><li><a href="https://snapchat-videos.techidaily.com/updated-drive-sales-through-smart-use-of-snapchats-tools/"><u>[Updated] Drive Sales Through Smart Use of Snapchat's Tools</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-your-daily-dose-of-humor-and-heartbreak-from-instagram-memes/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Your Daily Dose of Humor & Heartbreak From Instagram Memes</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-capture.techidaily.com/updated-playlists-that-rule-spotifys-top-10/"><u>[Updated] Playlists that Rule Spotify's Top 10</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-files.techidaily.com/updated-understanding-instagrams-video-restriction-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Understanding Instagram's Video Restriction for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/approved-how-to-blur-background-of-your-youtube-video/"><u>2024 Approved How to Blur Background of Your YouTube Video</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/halt-youtube-suggested-content-now-for-2024/"><u>Halt YouTube Suggested Content Now for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-record-videos.techidaily.com/in-2024-boost-production-value-with-free-sfx-libraries/"><u>In 2024, Boost Production Value with Free SFX Libraries!</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-files.techidaily.com/in-2024-unraveling-the-film-reel-how-to-rewind-on-instagram/"><u>In 2024, Unraveling the Film Reel How to Rewind on Instagram</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/leading-tag-tracker-software-on-major-platforms-like-fb-tweet-and-insta/"><u>Leading Tag Tracker Software on Major Platforms Like FB, Tweet & Insta</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/revolutionizing-in-car-experience-mercedes-benz-integrates-chatgpt-with-voice-control-features/"><u>Revolutionizing In-Car Experience: Mercedes-Benz Integrates ChatGPT with Voice Control Features</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

The action looks so slow that you think everything has stopped moving but in reality, it hasn’t – just slower than our eyes can normally perceive.</p><p>Slow-motion video is popular on Instagram Reels as well. In this article, we will show you how to</p><h4 id="In-this-article"><a href="#In-this-article" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 <a href="#part1">What is Slow Motion?</a></p><p>02 <a href="#part2">How Does Slow Motion Work On Instagram Reels?</a></p><p>03 <a href="#part3">How To Make Slow Motion Video On Instagram Reels?</a></p><p>04 <a href="#part4">How To Record Only Part Of A Video In Slow Motion On Reels?</a></p><p>05 <a href="#part5">How to Convert Normal Speed Video to Slow Motion For Reels?</a></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Slow-Motion"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Slow-Motion" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is Slow Motion?"></a>Part 1: What is Slow Motion?</h2><p>Slow-motion can be achieved by either dropping frames from a video sequence, or simply playing the existing frames in slow succession. It lets you capture some fun clips by turning everyday things into something special. For example, water droplets falling and causing different effects as they splatter and spread can be really fascinating to see, just like paint dropping onto a giant canvas.</p><p>That’s why it is very important to use high-resolution recording when shooting such video to prevent the stuttering effect. The higher the frame rate, the more we can slow down the action without noticeable jarring because each frame will be captured in more detail.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-Does-Slow-Motion-Work-On-Instagram-Reels"><a href="#Part-2-How-Does-Slow-Motion-Work-On-Instagram-Reels" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How Does Slow Motion Work On Instagram Reels?"></a>Part 2: How Does Slow Motion Work On Instagram Reels?</h2><p>Instagram Reels is a new feature within the Instagram app where users can create short 15-second videos and add them to their Instagram Stories. The new tool plays with time and motion in a creative way by letting you record clips but only keeps the last 15 seconds. While this might seem to limit at first, it actually opens up some creative possibilities for creating interesting vignettes. But how does the Instagram reels slow motion function work?</p><p>The secret behind Instagram reels slow-motion lies in its audio features. When recording a video, regardless of whether it’s in normal or slow-motion mode, you’ll be able to select songs from any music library that’s available on your device, add sound effects, and add voiceovers. Instagram takes advantage of this by speeding up the audio to a normal speed when you’re recording in slow motion and then slowing it down just enough so that it sounds natural when you playback the video at 1x speed. This means that your Reels videos will have a consistent volume even if you choose a song from a playlist with differing volumes.</p><p>This gives Reels users an interesting option: they can use songs from playlists where each track varies in terms of volume, thus creating some sort of visual story-telling through their 15-second clips.</p><p>But that’s not all; once you’ve recorded your video, you can add filters and editing tools to give it even more life.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-To-Make-Slow-Motion-Video-On-Instagram-Reels"><a href="#Part-3-How-To-Make-Slow-Motion-Video-On-Instagram-Reels" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How To Make Slow Motion Video On Instagram Reels?"></a>Part 3: How To Make Slow Motion Video On Instagram Reels?</h2><p>Instagram Reels is a feature that lets users create short videos consisting of multiple photos or clips placed together in order of their choice. The reels can be created from posts made by the user as well as from the user’s camera roll containing photos and videos taken before. These can even be edited further to add some filters or text to them. Once you are done creating a reel, you can share it on your Instagram story for friends and followers to see.</p><p>To understand how to make slow-motion video on Instagram reels, follow these steps:</p><p>First, launch the Instagram app and swipe right to reach the camera page. Alternatively, you could tap the Story button in the top left corner.</p><p>Now tap ‘Reels’ in the bottom panel beside ‘Story.’ You can select the time from here. The maximum time allowed is 60 sec for a reel.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/instagram-reels-recording-time-option.jpg"                      alt="instagram reels recording time option"                ></p><p>When recording a slow-motion video on Reels, you need to set the speed before you record the video. To do so, tap the ‘Speed’ button below your selected photo or clip-on Reels and select either 0.3x or 0.5x from the two options.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/instagram-reels-recording-speed-option.jpg"                      alt="instagram reels recording speed option"                ></p><p>Tap the camera button beside the ‘Speed’ button to take a test shot and see if you are satisfied with the speed. If not, either change it or tap the x on top to cancel this particular video. Once you are happy with your speed, tap on the red record button next to it to start recording your slow-motion video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/record-instagram-reels-video-slow-motion.jpg"                      alt="record instagram reels video slow motion"                ></p><p>While playing back your slow-motion video, swipe left or right on the screen to play at normal speed as well as 0.3x and 0.5x speeds, respectively, for comparison purposes. Keep swiping left and right until you find the perfect playback speed for your clip. You can also pinch inwards or outwards while watching a slow-motion video to adjust what you see in its frame at a particular time.</p><p>To stop recording, click on the red button. You can see a preview by clicking on the Preview button.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/preview-instagram-reels-slow-motion-video.jpg"                      alt="preview instagram reels slow motion video"                ></p><p>If you are okay with the video, click Next. Now, share it with reels.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/share-instagram-reels-slow-motion-video.jpg"                      alt="share instagram reels slow motion video"                ></p><p>Since the playback speed is not the only factor responsible for making videos look really slow-motion, it is equally important to ensure that your shots have an ample amount of action and motion in them. This way, when you choose to play them back at regular speeds or slower ones, their contents will be discernible enough to make a lasting impression on your audience. Depending on the kind of video you want to shoot, simply increase or decrease the number of clips that you use as well as their duration.</p><p>So, what more should you cater to understand how to make slow motion reels on Instagram?</p><p>When editing videos using Reels, make sure they don’t consist of too many unrelated photographs and videos. Try to make a video containing a single concept if possible; otherwise, it will be difficult for your audience to follow. Also, you can add effects or filters before publishing them on the platform, based on which they will look more impressive. In addition to this, you can also create longer slideshows of multiple reels by simply playing them one after the other either in the same order as that in which they were stacked together or by shuffling their order.</p><p>Play around with these settings and see what works best for you.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2118314/7443" target="_top" id="2118314">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2118314" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2118314/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-4-How-To-Record-Only-Part-Of-A-Video-In-Slow-Motion-On-Reels"><a href="#Part-4-How-To-Record-Only-Part-Of-A-Video-In-Slow-Motion-On-Reels" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How To Record Only Part Of A Video In Slow Motion On Reels?"></a>Part 4: How To Record Only Part Of A Video In Slow Motion On Reels?</h2><p>On Instagram, you can record a video in slow motion. You can even go further and record only a portion of your video in slow motion while the rest plays at an average speed rate. This gives an interesting effect to your videos where you’d want some parts to be played at normal speed and others played in slow motion.</p><ul><li>In this way, you can create exciting reels that will make people notice what they are all about! To do this, Go to the Instagram camera or Story page, and select Reels option.</li><li>You’ll have the choice to speed up or slow down various portions of the video or audio by selecting the speed as in the previous section.

It lets you capture some fun clips by turning everyday things into something special. For example, water droplets falling and causing different effects as they splatter and spread can be really fascinating to see, just like paint dropping onto a giant canvas.</p><p>That’s why it is very important to use high-resolution recording when shooting such video to prevent the stuttering effect. The higher the frame rate, the more we can slow down the action without noticeable jarring because each frame will be captured in more detail.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-Does-Slow-Motion-Work-On-Instagram-Reels-2"><a href="#Part-2-How-Does-Slow-Motion-Work-On-Instagram-Reels-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How Does Slow Motion Work On Instagram Reels?"></a>Part 2: How Does Slow Motion Work On Instagram Reels?</h2><p>Instagram Reels is a new feature within the Instagram app where users can create short 15-second videos and add them to their Instagram Stories. The new tool plays with time and motion in a creative way by letting you record clips but only keeps the last 15 seconds. While this might seem to limit at first, it actually opens up some creative possibilities for creating interesting vignettes. But how does the Instagram reels slow motion function work?</p><p>The secret behind Instagram reels slow-motion lies in its audio features. When recording a video, regardless of whether it’s in normal or slow-motion mode, you’ll be able to select songs from any music library that’s available on your device, add sound effects, and add voiceovers. Instagram takes advantage of this by speeding up the audio to a normal speed when you’re recording in slow motion and then slowing it down just enough so that it sounds natural when you playback the video at 1x speed. This means that your Reels videos will have a consistent volume even if you choose a song from a playlist with differing volumes.</p><p>This gives Reels users an interesting option: they can use songs from playlists where each track varies in terms of volume, thus creating some sort of visual story-telling through their 15-second clips.</p><p>But that’s not all; once you’ve recorded your video, you can add filters and editing tools to give it even more life.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-To-Make-Slow-Motion-Video-On-Instagram-Reels-2"><a href="#Part-3-How-To-Make-Slow-Motion-Video-On-Instagram-Reels-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How To Make Slow Motion Video On Instagram Reels?"></a>Part 3: How To Make Slow Motion Video On Instagram Reels?</h2><p>Instagram Reels is a feature that lets users create short videos consisting of multiple photos or clips placed together in order of their choice.

For example, water droplets falling and causing different effects as they splatter and spread can be really fascinating to see, just like paint dropping onto a giant canvas.</p><p>That’s why it is very important to use high-resolution recording when shooting such video to prevent the stuttering effect. The higher the frame rate, the more we can slow down the action without noticeable jarring because each frame will be captured in more detail.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-Does-Slow-Motion-Work-On-Instagram-Reels-3"><a href="#Part-2-How-Does-Slow-Motion-Work-On-Instagram-Reels-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How Does Slow Motion Work On Instagram Reels?"></a>Part 2: How Does Slow Motion Work On Instagram Reels?</h2><p>Instagram Reels is a new feature within the Instagram app where users can create short 15-second videos and add them to their Instagram Stories. The new tool plays with time and motion in a creative way by letting you record clips but only keeps the last 15 seconds. While this might seem to limit at first, it actually opens up some creative possibilities for creating interesting vignettes. But how does the Instagram reels slow motion function work?</p><p>The secret behind Instagram reels slow-motion lies in its audio features. When recording a video, regardless of whether it’s in normal or slow-motion mode, you’ll be able to select songs from any music library that’s available on your device, add sound effects, and add voiceovers. Instagram takes advantage of this by speeding up the audio to a normal speed when you’re recording in slow motion and then slowing it down just enough so that it sounds natural when you playback the video at 1x speed. This means that your Reels videos will have a consistent volume even if you choose a song from a playlist with differing volumes.</p><p>This gives Reels users an interesting option: they can use songs from playlists where each track varies in terms of volume, thus creating some sort of visual story-telling through their 15-second clips.</p><p>But that’s not all; once you’ve recorded your video, you can add filters and editing tools to give it even more life.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2082532/7443" target="_top" id="2082532">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2082532" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2082532/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-3-How-To-Make-Slow-Motion-Video-On-Instagram-Reels-3"><a href="#Part-3-How-To-Make-Slow-Motion-Video-On-Instagram-Reels-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How To Make Slow Motion Video On Instagram Reels?"></a>Part 3: How To Make Slow Motion Video On Instagram Reels?</h2><p>Instagram Reels is a feature that lets users create short videos consisting of multiple photos or clips placed together in order of their choice. The reels can be created from posts made by the user as well as from the user’s camera roll containing photos and videos taken before. These can even be edited further to add some filters or text to them. Once you are done creating a reel, you can share it on your Instagram story for friends and followers to see.</p><p>To understand how to make slow-motion video on Instagram reels, follow these steps:</p><p>First, launch the Instagram app and swipe right to reach the camera page. Alternatively, you could tap the Story button in the top left corner.</p><p>Now tap ‘Reels’ in the bottom panel beside ‘Story.’ You can select the time from here. The maximum time allowed is 60 sec for a reel.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/instagram-reels-recording-time-option.jpg"                      alt="instagram reels recording time option"                ></p><p>When recording a slow-motion video on Reels, you need to set the speed before you record the video. To do so, tap the ‘Speed’ button below your selected photo or clip-on Reels and select either 0.3x or 0.5x from the two options.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/instagram-reels-recording-speed-option.jpg"                      alt="instagram reels recording speed option"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1948895/19272" target="_top" id="1948895">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1948895" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1948895/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Tap the camera button beside the ‘Speed’ button to take a test shot and see if you are satisfied with the speed. If not, either change it or tap the x on top to cancel this particular video. Once you are happy with your speed, tap on the red record button next to it to start recording your slow-motion video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/record-instagram-reels-video-slow-motion.jpg"                      alt="record instagram reels video slow motion"                ></p><p>While playing back your slow-motion video, swipe left or right on the screen to play at normal speed as well as 0.3x and 0.5x speeds, respectively, for comparison purposes. Keep swiping left and right until you find the perfect playback speed for your clip. You can also pinch inwards or outwards while watching a slow-motion video to adjust what you see in its frame at a particular time.</p><p>To stop recording, click on the red button. You can see a preview by clicking on the Preview button.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/preview-instagram-reels-slow-motion-video.jpg"                      alt="preview instagram reels slow motion video"                ></p><p>If you are okay with the video, click Next.

This way, when you choose to play them back at regular speeds or slower ones, their contents will be discernible enough to make a lasting impression on your audience. Depending on the kind of video you want to shoot, simply increase or decrease the number of clips that you use as well as their duration.</p><p>So, what more should you cater to understand how to make slow motion reels on Instagram?</p><p>When editing videos using Reels, make sure they don’t consist of too many unrelated photographs and videos. Try to make a video containing a single concept if possible; otherwise, it will be difficult for your audience to follow. Also, you can add effects or filters before publishing them on the platform, based on which they will look more impressive. In addition to this, you can also create longer slideshows of multiple reels by simply playing them one after the other either in the same order as that in which they were stacked together or by shuffling their order.</p><p>Play around with these settings and see what works best for you.</p><h2 id="Part-4-How-To-Record-Only-Part-Of-A-Video-In-Slow-Motion-On-Reels-3"><a href="#Part-4-How-To-Record-Only-Part-Of-A-Video-In-Slow-Motion-On-Reels-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How To Record Only Part Of A Video In Slow Motion On Reels?"></a>Part 4: How To Record Only Part Of A Video In Slow Motion On Reels?</h2><p>On Instagram, you can record a video in slow motion. You can even go further and record only a portion of your video in slow motion while the rest plays at an average speed rate. This gives an interesting effect to your videos where you’d want some parts to be played at normal speed and others played in slow motion.</p><ul><li>In this way, you can create exciting reels that will make people notice what they are all about! To do this, Go to the Instagram camera or Story page, and select Reels option.</li><li>You’ll have the choice to speed up or slow down various portions of the video or audio by selecting the speed as in the previous section. For instance, if you want the first 20 seconds of video to be a slow motion at the speed of 0.3x, then select as shown below.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/start-part-of-instagram-reels-slow-motion-recording.jpg"                      alt="start part of instagram reels slow motion recording"                ></p><ul><li>And record the video till 40 seconds are left and stop.

Yes, you can. You can see who viewed your video or photo only when you upload it through the story. Your story allows you to see who viewed your photo or video. After you have uploaded a photo or a video in your story, you can easily track the people who viewed it by following few simple steps.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> After you have successfully uploaded your video or photo on your Instagram story, wait for some time so that people can see your story. After 5 to 10 minutes, tap on Your Story located at the top left corner of Instagram.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/who-viewed-your-instagram-step1.jpg"                      alt="how to check who view your instagram"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> When you tap on ‘Your Story’, a new window will open up showing you your image or video that you have uploaded.

Below your video or image, you can see ‘Liked by’. Click on the ‘others’ next to the name of the person who liked your post.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/viewed-your-instagram-using-likes-step1.png"                      alt="use likes to check who viewed your instagram"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Now at the top of the screen, you will see two numbers. The first number shows how many people have viewed your image or video and the second number shows the number of people who liked it. And the list below these numbers is the list of people who have liked your post.</p><p>Since this method doesn’t show you who viewed your Instagram post, it gives your few names in people who liked your post. These are the people who also viewed your post. I know this is not complete but Instagram doesn’t provide the data of people who viewed your post. So in that case, you can use this data to have an idea about who viewed your post.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/viewed-your-instagram-using-likes-step2.png"                      alt="use Instagram Likes to check who viewed your Instagram"                ></p><h2 id="How-to-see-who-viewed-your-Instagram-post-using-third-party-apps-Is-it-really-possible"><a href="#How-to-see-who-viewed-your-Instagram-post-using-third-party-apps-Is-it-really-possible" class="headerlink" title="How to see who viewed your Instagram post using third-party apps?

Is it really possible?</h2><p>After knowing that Instagram doesn’t provide the service to see who viewed your post, most users try to find alternative third-party apps that can help them achieve this task. You can easily find hundreds of apps that claim to show you who viewed your post as well as your profile. But don’t be fooled by these apps. When Instagram itself is not providing this data to its users and hiding this data, no one can do that for you. All the apps that claim to show you who viewed your profile and illegitimate and not trustworthy. By downloading and installing these apps into your phone, you are risking your privacy and security. Facebook acquired Instagram in 2016 ensures that there is no other way of how to see who viewed your Instagram posts because both Facebook and Instagram are using the same policies and site. Facebook doesn’t allow its user to access such data so does Instagram. There is no other way except the above two methods of how to see who viewed your Instagram post.</p><h2 id="Edit-Your-Instagram-Video-using-Wondershare-Filmora"><a href="#Edit-Your-Instagram-Video-using-Wondershare-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Edit Your Instagram Video using Wondershare Filmora"></a>Edit Your Instagram Video using <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h2><p>A well-made video is a secret to getting more followers on your Instagram.

So in that case, you can use this data to have an idea about who viewed your post.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/viewed-your-instagram-using-likes-step2.png"                      alt="use Instagram Likes to check who viewed your Instagram"                ></p><h2 id="How-to-see-who-viewed-your-Instagram-post-using-third-party-apps-Is-it-really-possible-3"><a href="#How-to-see-who-viewed-your-Instagram-post-using-third-party-apps-Is-it-really-possible-3" class="headerlink" title="How to see who viewed your Instagram post using third-party apps?

Is it really possible?</h2><p>After knowing that Instagram doesn’t provide the service to see who viewed your post, most users try to find alternative third-party apps that can help them achieve this task. You can easily find hundreds of apps that claim to show you who viewed your post as well as your profile. But don’t be fooled by these apps. When Instagram itself is not providing this data to its users and hiding this data, no one can do that for you. All the apps that claim to show you who viewed your profile and illegitimate and not trustworthy. By downloading and installing these apps into your phone, you are risking your privacy and security. Facebook acquired Instagram in 2016 ensures that there is no other way of how to see who viewed your Instagram posts because both Facebook and Instagram are using the same policies and site. Facebook doesn’t allow its user to access such data so does Instagram. There is no other way except the above two methods of how to see who viewed your Instagram post.</p><h2 id="Edit-Your-Instagram-Video-using-Wondershare-Filmora-3"><a href="#Edit-Your-Instagram-Video-using-Wondershare-Filmora-3" class="headerlink" title="Edit Your Instagram Video using Wondershare Filmora"></a>Edit Your Instagram Video using <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h2><p>A well-made video is a secret to getting more followers on your Instagram.

Snapseed is considered one of the best Instagram photo editor apps on Android, and it’s available on iOS too. Even better; it’s free!</p><p>Snapseed comes with 26 built-in tools and filters, including popular options like lens blur, HDR Scape, and vintage filters. You can even remove people from your selfies and isolate individual items in your image for separate editing from the rest. It’s considered one of the best image editors for serious photographers, which can mean there’s a rather steep learning curve but a climb certainly worth making judging by the spectacular results.</p><p>For <a class="link"   href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/snapseed/id439438619?mt=8" >iOS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For <a class="link"   href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.niksoftware.snapseed" >Android <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h4 id="2-Adobe-Photoshop-Express"><a href="#2-Adobe-Photoshop-Express" class="headerlink" title="2.

Free on iOS and Android, but with in-app purchases for the advanced features.</p><p>Expect to find all the usual tools such as crop, straighten and rotate, as well as tools to smooth, balance and remove red eye. If you’re keen to fork out for the advanced features, there’s even the ability to add objects from other photos to your images, creating highly unique and unusual results.</p><p>For <a class="link"   href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/adobe-photoshop-express/id331975235?mt=8" >iOS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For <a class="link"   href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.adobe.psmobile" >Android <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h4 id="3-VSCO"><a href="#3-VSCO" class="headerlink" title="3.

It can be used as a camera app as well as an Instagram photo editor app, meaning you can take better images in the first place as well as refine those you’ve already taken.</p><p>We like it because it’s simple. User friendly sliders help you adjust the lighting, sharpness, saturation and temperature as well as tinting and adding vignette effects to the photo. It’s available on both iOS and Android, free with all the basic tools and filters, although you can buy additional photo filter packs in the store.</p><p>For <a class="link"   href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/vsco/id588013838?mt=8" >iOS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For <a class="link"   href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.vsco.cam" >Android <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h4 id="4-Pixlr"><a href="#4-Pixlr" class="headerlink" title="4.

Although certainly very useful to those of us who didn’t want to pay for editing software, when the company was bought out by Autodesk in 2011, they finally brought the intuitive functionality of Pixlr to our smartphones too.</p><p>You can do pretty much everything you want with this sweet little Instagram photo editor app. Blur, sharpen, collage, add text, resize… you can even make your photo look like an ink drawing or a pencil sketch. With so many options, it can take a while to master, but there are numerous video tutorials online for support.</p><p>For <a class="link"   href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pixlr-photo-collages-effect/id526783584?mt=8" >iOS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For <a class="link"   href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pixlr.express" >Android <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h4 id="5-Facetune"><a href="#5-Facetune" class="headerlink" title="5.

Although rather controversial, the editing available from this little app is truly out of this world, with nothing else in the market quite matching it for selfie tuning. It costs $3.99 to download, but there are no more purchases to make once you’ve bought the software.</p><p>From a standard portrait, you can add make up, reduce wrinkles, sweep highlight over your cheeks or make your eyelashes look fuller. Enhance your cheekbones, straighten your nose, fill in patchy eyebrows and get an instant tooth whitening treatment… there’s really not much that this can’t improve on a face. If Instagram selfies are your thing, this is one to have a play with.</p><p>For <a class="link"   href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/facetune/id606310581?mt=8" >iOS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For <a class="link"   href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lightricks.facetune" >Android <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>There are many more Instagram photo editor app choices out there, so do take a look around and see what suits your needs the best. Do watch out for ‘free’ editing apps which have a rapidly approaching paywall; these we have mentioned here are perfectly functional without additional payment, but there are others which may not be as free as they first seem.</p><h3 id="Instagram-photo-editor-online"><a href="#Instagram-photo-editor-online" class="headerlink" title="Instagram photo editor online"></a>Instagram photo editor online</h3><p>If you prefer to use your PC to edit your photos, then there are plenty of options in the online world too. Here are five of the best Instagram photo editor options from the web.</p><h4 id="1-Canva"><a href="#1-Canva" class="headerlink" title="1. Canva"></a>1. <a class="link"   href="https://www.canva.com/" >Canva <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>If you haven’t come across Canva yet, it’s absolutely a tool to investigate if you love beautiful Instagram images. Choose their ‘social graphic 800 x 800px’ template for the perfect Instagram image size and upload your own photo to the editor with a click.</p><p>Once uploaded, you can add wording, filters and more to perfect your image. We love the funky fonts and word layouts, which are perfect for creating those shareable quotes and inspirational memes for your followers to enjoy. The software is free online, and although you do have to pay for some of the images and fonts, there’s plenty to do without paying a penny.</p><h4 id="2-Wondershare-PixStudio"><a href="#2-Wondershare-PixStudio" class="headerlink" title="2. Wondershare PixStudio"></a>2. <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/fotophire/download/" >Wondershare PixStudio <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>Wondershare PixStudio is an all-in-one and powerful online graphic design maker for everyone. It has various types of templates for YouTube Thumbnails, Logos, Posters, etc. You can create a beautiful design by simply dragging and dropping the elements and photos. The online platform is free to use all templates, just One-Click to download your creations and share to your Facebook, Instagram Story, and YouTube Thumbnails, etc. immediately.</p><p>PixStudio has special features to remove the image background. With a single click, you can quickly remove the image background, and use your image with more flexibility. Just payment of $7.99 per month to use the features.</p><h4 id="3-Fotor"><a href="#3-Fotor" class="headerlink" title="3. Fotor"></a>3. <a class="link"   href="https://www.fotor.com/" >Fotor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>Another free-to-use online Instagram photo editor is Fotor. It’s absolutely packed with tools and functions to prepare your images ready for sharing. It comes with filters of its own, many of which are not available on Instagram, as well as templates for adding text to your image.</p><p>The software works in layers, which can be a huge advantage if you’d like to add more to your picture. It also means you can work on various parts of the image without risking affecting any of the other layers, helping you to avoid non-undoable mistakes that simply ruin a morning’s work. As with Canva, there are some paid options, but enough to keep you busy without opening for wallet for sure.</p><h4 id="4-Pixlr-Editor"><a href="#4-Pixlr-Editor" class="headerlink" title="4. Pixlr Editor"></a>4. <a class="link"   href="https://pixlr.com/editor/" >Pixlr Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>If you’ve tried the Pixlr Express app and love it, why not step your game up a bit with the fully fledged Pixlr Editor. It’s a hairs breadth away from having full Photoshop functionality, but hallelujah it’s free!</p><p>It’s got layers, masks, clone stamps, lasso selection tools, and much, much more. If you’ve never used a pro photo editing suite before it might take a bit of getting used to, but it’s far and away the most powerful Instagram photo editor on the web. The only downside is that it’s fully Flash based, so access via a tablet is out.</p><h4 id="5-piZap"><a href="#5-piZap" class="headerlink" title="5. piZap"></a>5. <a class="link"   href="https://www.pizap.com/" >piZap <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>For those looking for a simpler, less fussy Instagram photo editor, piZap might be just what you need. It’s created solely for social sharing, and makes it easy to import photos from Facebook, Google Photos or wherever to work on with the editor.</p><p>Unlike Pixlr Editor, piZap works in both HTML5 and Flash, so you can use it whatever device you happen to be using. It bases its functionality on sliders, which you might find more user friendly than the drop-down menus of Fotor and Pixlr if you’re using your mobile device. Yes, it’s free, but there are lots more features available to those willing to pay for their account.</p><h4 id="6-Adobe-Spark-Post"><a href="#6-Adobe-Spark-Post" class="headerlink" title="6.

Choose their ‘social graphic 800 x 800px’ template for the perfect Instagram image size and upload your own photo to the editor with a click.</p><p>Once uploaded, you can add wording, filters and more to perfect your image. We love the funky fonts and word layouts, which are perfect for creating those shareable quotes and inspirational memes for your followers to enjoy. The software is free online, and although you do have to pay for some of the images and fonts, there’s plenty to do without paying a penny.</p><h4 id="2-Wondershare-PixStudio-1"><a href="#2-Wondershare-PixStudio-1" class="headerlink" title="2.

It’s absolutely packed with tools and functions to prepare your images ready for sharing. It comes with filters of its own, many of which are not available on Instagram, as well as templates for adding text to your image.</p><p>The software works in layers, which can be a huge advantage if you’d like to add more to your picture. It also means you can work on various parts of the image without risking affecting any of the other layers, helping you to avoid non-undoable mistakes that simply ruin a morning’s work. As with Canva, there are some paid options, but enough to keep you busy without opening for wallet for sure.</p><h4 id="4-Pixlr-Editor-1"><a href="#4-Pixlr-Editor-1" class="headerlink" title="4.

If you’ve never used a pro photo editing suite before it might take a bit of getting used to, but it’s far and away the most powerful Instagram photo editor on the web. The only downside is that it’s fully Flash based, so access via a tablet is out.</p><h4 id="5-piZap-1"><a href="#5-piZap-1" class="headerlink" title="5. piZap"></a>5. <a class="link"   href="https://www.pizap.com/" >piZap <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>For those looking for a simpler, less fussy Instagram photo editor, piZap might be just what you need. It’s created solely for social sharing, and makes it easy to import photos from Facebook, Google Photos or wherever to work on with the editor.</p><p>Unlike Pixlr Editor, piZap works in both HTML5 and Flash, so you can use it whatever device you happen to be using. It bases its functionality on sliders, which you might find more user friendly than the drop-down menus of Fotor and Pixlr if you’re using your mobile device. Yes, it’s free, but there are lots more features available to those willing to pay for their account.</p><h4 id="6-Adobe-Spark-Post-1"><a href="#6-Adobe-Spark-Post-1" class="headerlink" title="6.

Canva"></a>1. <a class="link"   href="https://www.canva.com/" >Canva <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>If you haven’t come across Canva yet, it’s absolutely a tool to investigate if you love beautiful Instagram images. Choose their ‘social graphic 800 x 800px’ template for the perfect Instagram image size and upload your own photo to the editor with a click.</p><p>Once uploaded, you can add wording, filters and more to perfect your image. We love the funky fonts and word layouts, which are perfect for creating those shareable quotes and inspirational memes for your followers to enjoy. The software is free online, and although you do have to pay for some of the images and fonts, there’s plenty to do without paying a penny.</p><h4 id="2-Wondershare-PixStudio-2"><a href="#2-Wondershare-PixStudio-2" class="headerlink" title="2. Wondershare PixStudio"></a>2. <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/fotophire/download/" >Wondershare PixStudio <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>Wondershare PixStudio is an all-in-one and powerful online graphic design maker for everyone. It has various types of templates for YouTube Thumbnails, Logos, Posters, etc. You can create a beautiful design by simply dragging and dropping the elements and photos. The online platform is free to use all templates, just One-Click to download your creations and share to your Facebook, Instagram Story, and YouTube Thumbnails, etc. immediately.</p><p>PixStudio has special features to remove the image background. With a single click, you can quickly remove the image background, and use your image with more flexibility. Just payment of $7.99 per month to use the features.</p><h4 id="3-Fotor-2"><a href="#3-Fotor-2" class="headerlink" title="3. Fotor"></a>3. <a class="link"   href="https://www.fotor.com/" >Fotor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>Another free-to-use online Instagram photo editor is Fotor. It’s absolutely packed with tools and functions to prepare your images ready for sharing. It comes with filters of its own, many of which are not available on Instagram, as well as templates for adding text to your image.</p><p>The software works in layers, which can be a huge advantage if you’d like to add more to your picture. It also means you can work on various parts of the image without risking affecting any of the other layers, helping you to avoid non-undoable mistakes that simply ruin a morning’s work. As with Canva, there are some paid options, but enough to keep you busy without opening for wallet for sure.</p><h4 id="4-Pixlr-Editor-2"><a href="#4-Pixlr-Editor-2" class="headerlink" title="4. Pixlr Editor"></a>4. <a class="link"   href="https://pixlr.com/editor/" >Pixlr Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>If you’ve tried the Pixlr Express app and love it, why not step your game up a bit with the fully fledged Pixlr Editor. It’s a hairs breadth away from having full Photoshop functionality, but hallelujah it’s free!</p><p>It’s got layers, masks, clone stamps, lasso selection tools, and much, much more. If you’ve never used a pro photo editing suite before it might take a bit of getting used to, but it’s far and away the most powerful Instagram photo editor on the web. The only downside is that it’s fully Flash based, so access via a tablet is out.</p><h4 id="5-piZap-2"><a href="#5-piZap-2" class="headerlink" title="5. piZap"></a>5. <a class="link"   href="https://www.pizap.com/" >piZap <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>For those looking for a simpler, less fussy Instagram photo editor, piZap might be just what you need. It’s created solely for social sharing, and makes it easy to import photos from Facebook, Google Photos or wherever to work on with the editor.</p><p>Unlike Pixlr Editor, piZap works in both HTML5 and Flash, so you can use it whatever device you happen to be using. It bases its functionality on sliders, which you might find more user friendly than the drop-down menus of Fotor and Pixlr if you’re using your mobile device. Yes, it’s free, but there are lots more features available to those willing to pay for their account.</p><h4 id="6-Adobe-Spark-Post-2"><a href="#6-Adobe-Spark-Post-2" class="headerlink" title="6. Adobe Spark Post"></a>6. <a class="link"   href="https://spark.adobe.com/" >Adobe Spark Post <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>From the photo geniuses (genii?) at Adobe comes this easy to use, fun and free photo editor, perfect for Instagram-worthy compositions. Choose from a selection of templates or start from scratch, and add filters, layers and beautiful text to anything.</p><p>It’s all free, although businesses might want to consider upgrading to the paid version, as this allows the removal of the Adobe Spark logo from your posts. It also gives live phone and chat support and the options for branded templates, and costs just $10 a month with no ongoing commitment.</p><p>Most of these online Instagram photo editors have been designed to work with all major browsers, including Safari, Chrome, Firefox and Edge. However, if you’re having problems getting them to work on your PC or tablet, do try them in another browser as there have been some conflictions reported.</p><h3 id="Conclusion-2"><a href="#Conclusion-2" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>There you have our pick of the best Instagram photo editor apps and online services, many of which are completely free to use.

With so many options, it can take a while to master, but there are numerous video tutorials online for support.</p><p>For <a class="link"   href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pixlr-photo-collages-effect/id526783584?mt=8" >iOS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For <a class="link"   href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pixlr.express" >Android <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h4 id="5-Facetune-3"><a href="#5-Facetune-3" class="headerlink" title="5.

Although rather controversial, the editing available from this little app is truly out of this world, with nothing else in the market quite matching it for selfie tuning. It costs $3.99 to download, but there are no more purchases to make once you’ve bought the software.</p><p>From a standard portrait, you can add make up, reduce wrinkles, sweep highlight over your cheeks or make your eyelashes look fuller. Enhance your cheekbones, straighten your nose, fill in patchy eyebrows and get an instant tooth whitening treatment… there’s really not much that this can’t improve on a face. If Instagram selfies are your thing, this is one to have a play with.</p><p>For <a class="link"   href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/facetune/id606310581?mt=8" >iOS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For <a class="link"   href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lightricks.facetune" >Android <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>There are many more Instagram photo editor app choices out there, so do take a look around and see what suits your needs the best. Do watch out for ‘free’ editing apps which have a rapidly approaching paywall; these we have mentioned here are perfectly functional without additional payment, but there are others which may not be as free as they first seem.</p><h3 id="Instagram-photo-editor-online-3"><a href="#Instagram-photo-editor-online-3" class="headerlink" title="Instagram photo editor online"></a>Instagram photo editor online</h3><p>If you prefer to use your PC to edit your photos, then there are plenty of options in the online world too. Here are five of the best Instagram photo editor options from the web.</p><h4 id="1-Canva-3"><a href="#1-Canva-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Canva"></a>1. <a class="link"   href="https://www.canva.com/" >Canva <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>If you haven’t come across Canva yet, it’s absolutely a tool to investigate if you love beautiful Instagram images. Choose their ‘social graphic 800 x 800px’ template for the perfect Instagram image size and upload your own photo to the editor with a click.</p><p>Once uploaded, you can add wording, filters and more to perfect your image. We love the funky fonts and word layouts, which are perfect for creating those shareable quotes and inspirational memes for your followers to enjoy. The software is free online, and although you do have to pay for some of the images and fonts, there’s plenty to do without paying a penny.</p><h4 id="2-Wondershare-PixStudio-3"><a href="#2-Wondershare-PixStudio-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Wondershare PixStudio"></a>2. <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/fotophire/download/" >Wondershare PixStudio <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>Wondershare PixStudio is an all-in-one and powerful online graphic design maker for everyone. It has various types of templates for YouTube Thumbnails, Logos, Posters, etc. You can create a beautiful design by simply dragging and dropping the elements and photos. The online platform is free to use all templates, just One-Click to download your creations and share to your Facebook, Instagram Story, and YouTube Thumbnails, etc. immediately.</p><p>PixStudio has special features to remove the image background. With a single click, you can quickly remove the image background, and use your image with more flexibility. Just payment of $7.99 per month to use the features.</p><h4 id="3-Fotor-3"><a href="#3-Fotor-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Fotor"></a>3. <a class="link"   href="https://www.fotor.com/" >Fotor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>Another free-to-use online Instagram photo editor is Fotor. It’s absolutely packed with tools and functions to prepare your images ready for sharing. It comes with filters of its own, many of which are not available on Instagram, as well as templates for adding text to your image.</p><p>The software works in layers, which can be a huge advantage if you’d like to add more to your picture. It also means you can work on various parts of the image without risking affecting any of the other layers, helping you to avoid non-undoable mistakes that simply ruin a morning’s work. As with Canva, there are some paid options, but enough to keep you busy without opening for wallet for sure.</p><h4 id="4-Pixlr-Editor-3"><a href="#4-Pixlr-Editor-3" class="headerlink" title="4. Pixlr Editor"></a>4. <a class="link"   href="https://pixlr.com/editor/" >Pixlr Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>If you’ve tried the Pixlr Express app and love it, why not step your game up a bit with the fully fledged Pixlr Editor. It’s a hairs breadth away from having full Photoshop functionality, but hallelujah it’s free!</p><p>It’s got layers, masks, clone stamps, lasso selection tools, and much, much more. If you’ve never used a pro photo editing suite before it might take a bit of getting used to, but it’s far and away the most powerful Instagram photo editor on the web. The only downside is that it’s fully Flash based, so access via a tablet is out.</p><h4 id="5-piZap-3"><a href="#5-piZap-3" class="headerlink" title="5. piZap"></a>5. <a class="link"   href="https://www.pizap.com/" >piZap <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>For those looking for a simpler, less fussy Instagram photo editor, piZap might be just what you need. It’s created solely for social sharing, and makes it easy to import photos from Facebook, Google Photos or wherever to work on with the editor.</p><p>Unlike Pixlr Editor, piZap works in both HTML5 and Flash, so you can use it whatever device you happen to be using. It bases its functionality on sliders, which you might find more user friendly than the drop-down menus of Fotor and Pixlr if you’re using your mobile device. Yes, it’s free, but there are lots more features available to those willing to pay for their account.</p><h4 id="6-Adobe-Spark-Post-3"><a href="#6-Adobe-Spark-Post-3" class="headerlink" title="6. Adobe Spark Post"></a>6. <a class="link"   href="https://spark.adobe.com/" >Adobe Spark Post <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>From the photo geniuses (genii?) at Adobe comes this easy to use, fun and free photo editor, perfect for Instagram-worthy compositions. Choose from a selection of templates or start from scratch, and add filters, layers and beautiful text to anything.</p><p>It’s all free, although businesses might want to consider upgrading to the paid version, as this allows the removal of the Adobe Spark logo from your posts. It also gives live phone and chat support and the options for branded templates, and costs just $10 a month with no ongoing commitment.</p><p>Most of these online Instagram photo editors have been designed to work with all major browsers, including Safari, Chrome, Firefox and Edge. However, if you’re having problems getting them to work on your PC or tablet, do try them in another browser as there have been some conflictions reported.</p><h3 id="Conclusion-3"><a href="#Conclusion-3" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>There you have our pick of the best Instagram photo editor apps and online services, many of which are completely free to use. As to which is the absolute best, it will entirely depend on what you are looking to achieve and how complicated you want to make things.</p><p>Many of these Instagram photo editor apps and online services offer fairly basic functionality, which means you can get to grips with them in a matter of moments. More complex software will take more time to get to know but will certainly produce much better results. Why not try out a few and see how you get on, and let us know which of these Instagram photo editor solutions you like the best?</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shannon-cox.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1982461">                    <video width="576" height="240" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1982461.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1982461">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1982461.png"                      style="border: none;

One of the best ways to do that is by using a reliable <strong>Instagram grid maker</strong>. For instance, with an Instagram grid planner, you can come up with an overall theme for your profile or connect various posts via a puzzle. To help you elevate the creative and visual appeal of your profile, I’m going to make you familiar with the 10 best grid makers for Instagram.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: What are Instagram Grids All About?</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 2: The 6 Best Online Grid Makers for Instagram</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Part 3: Top 4 Grid Makers for Instagram [for Android and iOS]</a></li><li><a href="#part4">Part 4: How to Make an Appealing Photo Grid on Instagram?</a></li><li><a href="#part5">Part 5: Creative Ideas to Implement Instagram Grid Layouts</a></li></ul><h2 id="Part-1-What-are-Instagram-Grids-All-About"><a href="#Part-1-What-are-Instagram-Grids-All-About" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What are Instagram Grids All About?"></a>Part 1: What are Instagram Grids All About?</h2><p>You might already know that Instagram displays our posts in a 3-column layout. Therefore, to make the most of this layout, a lot of people work on the overall 3x3 grid (3 rows and 3 columns).</p><p>To catch the attention of their audience, you can come up with an overall theme for your profile using 9 posts (a 3x3 grid). For instance, you can see here is a perfect example of a puzzle grid in which some parts of a post are overlapping on the adjacent posts. This would make the overall profile look uniform and more aesthetically pleasing.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/what-are-instagram-grids.jpg"                      alt="what are instagram grids"                ></p><p>Just like this, there can be so many ways in which we can plan the layout of a grid for our Instagram profile.</p><h2 id="Part-2-The-6-Best-Online-Grid-Makers-for-Instagram"><a href="#Part-2-The-6-Best-Online-Grid-Makers-for-Instagram" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: The 6 Best Online Grid Makers for Instagram"></a>Part 2: The 6 Best Online Grid Makers for Instagram</h2><p>In case you are also looking for an online Instagram grid maker, then you can simply explore these options:</p><h4 id="1-My-Social-Boutique"><a href="#1-My-Social-Boutique" class="headerlink" title="1.My Social Boutique"></a>1.<a class="link"   href="https://mysocialboutique.co/" >My Social Boutique <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>If you are looking for free or paid Instagram grid templates, then you can head to My Social Boutique.

To use this free photo grid Instagram tool, just go through these steps:</p><p><strong>Step 1: Upload the image you want to split</strong></p><p>At first, you can just go to the official website of Image Splitter by Postcron and click on the “Upload Image” button from its home. This will open a dedicated Instagram grid maker online tool.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/upload-image-splitter.jpg"                      alt="upload image splitter"                ></p><p>You can now just drag and drop an image that you want to split or click on the “Upload” button to browse and load it from your computer.</p><p><strong>Step 2: Choose how you want to split the image</strong></p><p>Great!

On the side, you can just enter the number of rows and columns in which you want to split the image. For instance, to get a 3x3 Instagram grid layout, you can set the number of columns and rows as 3.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/choose-how-split-image.jpg"                      alt="choose how split image"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3: Split your image and save all photos</strong></p><p>After setting a preferred ratio for the grid, you can also select a respective image format to export your files (like JPG or PNG). In the end, just click on the “Split Image” button and wait as the application would split your photos in a specific ratio.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/split-image-save-photo.jpg"                      alt="split image save photo"                ></p><p>When the process is completed, the online grid maker for Instagram will let you know.

To use this free photo grid Instagram tool, just go through these steps:</p><p><strong>Step 1: Upload the image you want to split</strong></p><p>At first, you can just go to the official website of Image Splitter by Postcron and click on the “Upload Image” button from its home. This will open a dedicated Instagram grid maker online tool.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/upload-image-splitter.jpg"                      alt="upload image splitter"                ></p><p>You can now just drag and drop an image that you want to split or click on the “Upload” button to browse and load it from your computer.</p><p><strong>Step 2: Choose how you want to split the image</strong></p><p>Great! Once the image has been loaded, you can simply check its preview on the side. Now, you can just crop the part of the image that you want to split from here. On the side, you can just enter the number of rows and columns in which you want to split the image. For instance, to get a 3x3 Instagram grid layout, you can set the number of columns and rows as 3.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/choose-how-split-image.jpg"                      alt="choose how split image"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3: Split your image and save all photos</strong></p><p>After setting a preferred ratio for the grid, you can also select a respective image format to export your files (like JPG or PNG). In the end, just click on the “Split Image” button and wait as the application would split your photos in a specific ratio.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/split-image-save-photo.jpg"                      alt="split image save photo"                ></p><p>When the process is completed, the online grid maker for Instagram will let you know.
