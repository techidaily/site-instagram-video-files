Introducing the chat feature, stories, IGTV, and its most recent update of the Instagram Reels, Instagram continues to seize the market. It is now the sixth most popular social media platform with more than one billion active users.

Here, in this article, we will familiarize you with how to make and create reels on Instagram and 10 interesting facts about the latest update.

### #1\. Why Instagram launched Reels? Copy TikTok?

As a competitor to various apps, Instagram has adapted to the latest trends pretty quickly. With the boom of TikTok, Instagram followed suit and launched Reels to attract content creators and different brands.

The few differences are that Instagram provides many other features as well but on the other hand time limit on TikTok is up to 1 minute. Furthermore, Reels disappear after 24 hours, where TikTok videos don’t.
