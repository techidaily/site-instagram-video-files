#### Create your bang

You must grab the user's attention quickly by giving a sort of bang in the initial seconds.

#### Trigger people to comment on

You can include some random details also so that people get induced to comment on your Instagram Reels. These unexpected details can be anything such as mentioning some weird stuff or writing great captions etc.
