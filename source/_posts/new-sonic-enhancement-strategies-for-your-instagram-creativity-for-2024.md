## Part 5: How to Add Your Own Voice to Instagram Reels?

If you don't want to add music as your background sound, instead use your voice as a voiceover; Instagram has the voiceover feature that will let you do that. However, you can apply this feature only after finishing your recording.

**Step 1:** Open your Instagram account and click on your profile to start recording for your Reel. And then record the video as usual for the Reel.

**Step 2:** If you want to add music, you can do that; if not, just let it be. After the recording is done, you will be taken to another page. Here, you will see some option right at the top of the recorded video. Click on the Microphone icon.
