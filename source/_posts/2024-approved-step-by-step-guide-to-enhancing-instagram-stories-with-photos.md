Here is a step-by-step guide on how to put more than one picture on Instagram's story without the aid of any third-party software.

**Step 1**: Sign in to your Instagram account if not logged in already.

**Step 2**: By clicking on the Camera icon present on the top left corner of the screen, you will get directed to the stories page. If you don't have any active stories, the "+" sign on the screen's bottom can do the task.

Doing so will lead to the page where you come across the image uploading. Click on the Image icon present on the left corner to open up the phone's camera roll. If you wish to take a fresh shot, you can click on the camera option too.

**Step 3**: Now, you can select the images you wish to upload to the Instagram story. Click on the "Select Multiple" option from the top corner.

The images or photos stored in the gallery will appear on the screen and get marked by numbers based on your selection. You can reorder them if needed.

**Step 4**: Instagram allows you to add crazy stickers, emoji, drawings, text, location tags, gifs, and other accounts to your story that could improve your personality, enhance chances of reach, and boost engagement. [You can also add music to your Instagram Story to attract viewers](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

If you are okay with the editing and happy with the final look, it's now time to gets it published by clicking on the "Next" button present on the bottom of the screen. Your story is now live, that would last for 24 hours.

Congratulations, the task is now over, and this is how to put multiple pictures on Instagram story.

There is another way to put more than one picture on the Instagram story and here are the steps of a photo sticker feature.

**Step 1**: Log into your Instagram account.

**Step 2**: Take a fresh shot with the camera icon or just upload the images from the camera roll using the "+" symbol.

**Step 3**: Select the photo sticker option.

**Step 4**: Now, add more photos to your Instagram story with the "image select" option. Such action results in many photos on a single Instagram story like a collage.

**Note**: The photo sticker may not be available in everyone's account.
