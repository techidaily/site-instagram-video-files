* The font of the lyric can also be changed
* You can even change the color of the music player or the lyrics

First, let me enlighten you on how to use some of the features:

1\. In the Effects tab, choose from over 120 Filters or Overlays to give a cinematic look to your video. By using Mosaic, you can blur out certain parts of the video. You can even add multiple Mosaic filters.

2.Add emojis from the vast library in the Elements tab or get free packages in Filmstock for more cute effects.

### Over To You

Now that I have shared all the details on the Instagram music sticker, it's up to you how you use it to your advantage. You may share your favorite songs or delight your audience with a story worth watching.

There is no denying that a song makes videos much more enjoyable. Add a few special effects with Filmora, and there is a spectacular video ready to be shared with the world.

Ready to take over Instagram with your creativity?
