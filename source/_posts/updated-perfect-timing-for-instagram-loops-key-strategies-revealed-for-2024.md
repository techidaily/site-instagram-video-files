Looping a particular scene adds a lot of excitement to the video, and it has become a significant element of the Instagram experience. For those who don’t want to download and install any software program on your computer, we recommend you to use some online tools to loop video.

### 2. Kapwing

Kapwing is a free online tool which allows you to loop, clip, and trim the video to make them a lot more interesting. The only downside of this tool is that it only lets you loop the video a maximum of 10 times. Here is a simple step-by-step guide on how to loop videos using Kapwing.

 **Step 1:** Visit the Loop Video in Kapwing on your browser, and then upload your video by clicking on the "Upload" button, or you can also upload the video by pasting its URL link.
