## Part 4: How to Make an Instagram Puzzle Feed Instantly via Canva?

You can find tons of customizable templates for making an Instagram puzzle feed that can be used on platforms like Photoshop or Canva. If you want, you can also come up with a puzzle feed on Instagram via Canva from scratch. It is a freely available online editor that offers tons of templates and options to create social media posts.

Here’s how you can also come up with a customizable puzzle feed for Instagram using Canva:

**Step 1: Choose to work on a custom design on Canva**

At first, you can just go to the official website of Canva, log in to your account, and choose to work on a Custom Design from its home. Here, you can enter the size as 3240x3240 pixels to work on a set of 3x3 images (since an ideal Instagram post is of 1080x1080 pixels).

![login canva make puzzle feed](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/login-canva-make-puzzle-feed.jpg)

**Step 2: Add Grids to your Custom Design on Canva**

This will simply open a new canvas on your interface so that you can add all kinds of elements. Now, go to the sidebar and under the Elements section, look for “Grids”. From here, you can add a 3x3 grid to get 9 equal images. If you want, you can make a grid and canvas of any other preferred size as well.

![add grids to puzzle feed](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/add-grids-to-puzzle-feed.jpg)

**Step 3: Add Elements and Photos to your Grid**

Once the grid is created, you can just drag and drop all kinds of elements or pictures on it. At first, I would recommend adding photos so that you can easily place them and get their right placement on the canvas.

![add elements to grid](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/add-elements-to-grid.jpg)

Following the same approach, you can find all kinds of elements on the sidebar that you can add to your grid. For instance, you can add headlines, texts, lines, vectors, and so much more.

![add photo to grid](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/add-photo-to-grid.jpg)

**Step 4: Split and Post your Photos on Instagram**

That’s it! Once you have worked on the entire grid, you can go to the Export button and save the entire grid image on your system. Later, you can use any free solution (like Pine Tools) to split the grid into individual 1080x1080 photos for your Instagram feed.

![split grid ig puzzle](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/split-grid-ig-puzzle.jpg)

## Part 5: Effective Instagram Puzzle Feed Ideas

As you can see, it can be quite easy to come up with a puzzle feed for Instagram on Canva. To get even better results, you can consider implementing these Instagram puzzle feed ideas as well.

#### Less is More

A lot of people make the rookie mistake of adding too many design elements while creating an Instagram puzzle feed. Remember, your focus should be on your content and other elements are there to simply elevate the visual appeal of your feed.

#### Be Consistent

If you have just started with a puzzle theme on Instagram, then be consistent and stick to it for a while. For instance, if you would keep changing the overall theme after every 9 posts, then it will make your account look cluttered.

#### Consider your account’s theme

Don’t go with any free or paid Instagram puzzle feed just because it looks appealing. You should consider the overall theme of your brand or personal account. The template should reflect the idea of your business. For instance, luxury brands can go with bold colors while fashion influencers can have some contrasting gradients on their template.

## Part 4: How to Make an Instagram Puzzle Feed Instantly via Canva?

You can find tons of customizable templates for making an Instagram puzzle feed that can be used on platforms like Photoshop or Canva. If you want, you can also come up with a puzzle feed on Instagram via Canva from scratch. It is a freely available online editor that offers tons of templates and options to create social media posts.

Here’s how you can also come up with a customizable puzzle feed for Instagram using Canva:

**Step 1: Choose to work on a custom design on Canva**

At first, you can just go to the official website of Canva, log in to your account, and choose to work on a Custom Design from its home. Here, you can enter the size as 3240x3240 pixels to work on a set of 3x3 images (since an ideal Instagram post is of 1080x1080 pixels).

![login canva make puzzle feed](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/login-canva-make-puzzle-feed.jpg)

**Step 2: Add Grids to your Custom Design on Canva**

This will simply open a new canvas on your interface so that you can add all kinds of elements. Now, go to the sidebar and under the Elements section, look for “Grids”. From here, you can add a 3x3 grid to get 9 equal images. If you want, you can make a grid and canvas of any other preferred size as well.

![add grids to puzzle feed](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/add-grids-to-puzzle-feed.jpg)

**Step 3: Add Elements and Photos to your Grid**

Once the grid is created, you can just drag and drop all kinds of elements or pictures on it. At first, I would recommend adding photos so that you can easily place them and get their right placement on the canvas.

## Part 5: Effective Instagram Puzzle Feed Ideas

As you can see, it can be quite easy to come up with a puzzle feed for Instagram on Canva. To get even better results, you can consider implementing these Instagram puzzle feed ideas as well.

#### Less is More

A lot of people make the rookie mistake of adding too many design elements while creating an Instagram puzzle feed. Remember, your focus should be on your content and other elements are there to simply elevate the visual appeal of your feed.

#### Be Consistent

If you have just started with a puzzle theme on Instagram, then be consistent and stick to it for a while. For instance, if you would keep changing the overall theme after every 9 posts, then it will make your account look cluttered.

#### Consider your account’s theme

Don’t go with any free or paid Instagram puzzle feed just because it looks appealing. You should consider the overall theme of your brand or personal account. The template should reflect the idea of your business. For instance, luxury brands can go with bold colors while fashion influencers can have some contrasting gradients on their template.
