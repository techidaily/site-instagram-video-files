## Part 1: How to Speed up Video for Instagram on iPhone with Hyperlapse?

When speeding up Instagram videos, Hyperlapse is unquestionably the most acceptable option for iPhone users. A supplementary app (Hyperlapse) for Instagram is specifically developed to allow users to accelerate Instagram video speed.

![hyperlapse from instagram](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/hyperlapse-from-instagram.jpg)

You have the option of uploading a video from your iPhone or shooting a movie from inside the application. By default, your video is being played at a speed of 6X. This software, however, also has several drawbacks. For example, it can only assist you in increasing the pace of the videos. There are no editing features.

To know how to speed up a video for Instagram using Hyperlapse, follow these steps:

**Step 1:** Launch Hyperlapse on your iPhone, press the **record** button. Stop filming anytime you wish and keep your hands motionless.

**Step 2:** You'll see a speedometer now. The default speed is **6X**, but you may lower it to **1X** or boost it to **12X** if you choose. Move to the right to speed up the video.

**Step 3:** Right after you've chosen your desired speed, click "OK." If you want to share the video, you may do so on social media platforms like Instagram and Facebook.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## Part 2: How to Speed up Video for Instagram on Android with Filmora?

This application allows you to convert any video into a slow or fast motion video with no effort.

However, you can only increase the video speed by a factor of two at the most.

To know how to speed up existing video for Instagram with Filmora, follow these steps:

**Step 1:** Touch New Project to begin a new filming session at the bottom of the screen.

**Step 2:** Choose the video you want to speed up and hit **Import**. After the editor is opened, you may begin editing. In the toolbar at the very bottom of the screen, choose **Trim**.
