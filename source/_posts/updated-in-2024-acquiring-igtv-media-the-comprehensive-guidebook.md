## How to Download IGTV Videos on iPhone and Android Devices \[5 ways\]

Respecting the copyright laws is of utmost importance because the violation of intellectual property rights is considered a criminal offense. Posting the videos you downloaded from IGTV on your channel and claiming them as your own is considered illegal, so make sure that you have the necessary permission to upload a video before you share it on IGTV. Okay, let's have a look at different ways of downloading IGTV videos to a Smartphone.

#### 1. Using the Siri Shortcuts app to Download IGTV Videos

iPhone owners who have iOS 12 installed on their devices can download the [Shortcuts app](https://itunes.apple.com/app/shortcuts/id915249334) and use it to save IGTV videos to the camera roll. So, once you’ve installed this app on your iPhone, you will be able to access the **Download from the Instagram** option that allows you to save Instagram stories, IGTV videos to your phone. In addition, you can use this option **to repost videos on your IGTV channel**, but you shouldn’t do this without permission from the creator whose video you downloaded. Simply **copy the URL** of the video you’d like to download and paste it into this [shortcut](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/424a14194efe44cfac0c409fdfa2b164). You can also **use the voice commands to ask Siri to launch the app for you**.

#### 2. Downloading IGTV Videos With Documents6 on iPhones

[Documents](https://readdle.com/documents) is basically a file manager that lets you view different types of files from an iPhone. In order to start downloading an IGTV video, you first need to **copy its URL**, and then open the Documents app. Tap on the **Browser icon** in the lower right corner of the screen and then go to [IOTransfer](https://www.iotransfer.net/instagram-video-downloader.php), a free online Instagram video downloader. Simply **paste the URL** into the appropriate box, and hit the **Download to PC** button to analyze the video. A download link will appear on the screen, so you just have to tap on it and then proceed to save the IGTV video to your iPhone. Optionally, you can rename the file before downloading it.

#### 3. Using the IGTV Video Downloader to Download Videos on Android

Saving IGTV videos to an Android phone is much faster and easier than downloading videos from IGTV to an iPhone. All you have to do is install the [IGTV Video Downloader](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=app.igtvdownloader.app) app on your device. The app can be downloaded from Google Play for free, but it contains ads, which can be somewhat frustrating. Launch the **Instagram app**, and head over to IGTV to select the video you want to download. **Copy the IGTV video’s link** and **paste it to the IGTV Video Downloader app**. Tap on the **Download button** and wait for the download process to be completed. The file will be stored in your phone’s gallery, so you can access it quickly and watch it whenever you want.

#### 4. Downloading IGTV Videos with Saveo on Android

[Saveo](https://en.softonic.com/solutions/apps/saveo?rel=362940) is yet another Android app you can use to download videos from IGTV. Even though you can use this app for free, you will not be able to find it on the Play Store. The process of downloading IGTV videos with Saveo is rather simple since you just have to **launch the app**, tap on the **Instagram icon** in the upper right corner of the app’s main window, and then find the video you’d like to download or repost. Tap on the **three-dot icon**, located next to the Like and Comment options, and then tap on the **Copy Link** property. You will be then taken back to the Saveo app where you just have to tap on the **Download button**, and the download process will commence immediately. You can keep track of the download progress in your phone’s notification bar.

#### 5. Using the Keep It Android-based App to Download IGTV Videos

After installing and launching the [Keep It Video Downloader for Instagram and IGTV](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nexa.xsaver.photovideodownloader&hl=en%5F), you just have to tap on the **Start Service option** in order to enable it. Tap on the **Open Instagram** button and then click on the **three-dot icon** and select the **Copy Link option**. The download will start as soon as you copy the video’s link and you can download multiple videos simultaneously. All videos you download will be stored in the app’s **My Downloads folder**, so you can watch them or share them effortlessly.

## Conclusion

Downloading IGTV videos is a straightforward process, that doesn’t require too much of your time, because in most cases you just have to copy and paste the video’s URL to an app on your phone. At the moment, downloading IGTV videos to iPhones is a bit more complicated than saving IGTV to an Android device, because there are no apps on the App Store that enable you to save images and videos from Instagram directly to your phone. Which method of downloading IGTV videos do you like to use the most? Leave a comment below and lets us know.
