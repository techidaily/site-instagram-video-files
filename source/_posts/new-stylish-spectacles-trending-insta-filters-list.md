#### Sharing the process and Behind the Scenes

One can share the process of making something. The audience and customers love when they have access to exclusive footage from the factory whilst they prepare their product. Not only this, but the views from behind the scenes also engage a great number of audiences. Allow me to introduce you to Wondershare Filmstock that features video effects incorporated into these ideas to make them lively.

[**Instagram Title Pack**](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) does the charm by adding customized texts and animated tiles while showing off their brand product and the process. A pack to count on anytime, don't you agree?

#### Brand and Team Introductions

The business is done with the people, and the audience often prefers the brand that keeps its team in the loop. It is an amazing idea to first introduce the brand and answer questions like what it is bringing to the table, the target market, and how you are willing to solve problems. In the same way, the team introduction will also develop an emotional connection with the people.

With [**Instagram Stories Pack Vol1**](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), you can insert fashionable templates whilst introducing the brand and team. Furthermore, one can swipe up to know more about the company and people working there.

#### Promoting Posts on Stories

Another way to advertise your Instagram-based brand is to share the recent post as a story and hide it with some sticker. This will enhance the curiosity to see the actual post and bring them directly to your Instagram blog.

To do this like a pro, let me present to you [**Instagram Stories Pack Vol2**](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). This pack permits the user to share their favorite posts and moments from the blog and let the world have a look at them in the most engaging way possible.
