* The font of the lyric can also be changed
* You can even change the color of the music player or the lyrics

2.Click on Stickers on the top and choose 'Music' from the stickers

3.Tap on Music, and you will be presented with a list of songs. Categorized as popular, genre, and moods so that you can quickly swipe through the desired list to choose a perfect piece. Or you can even search for a specific song in the search bar above
