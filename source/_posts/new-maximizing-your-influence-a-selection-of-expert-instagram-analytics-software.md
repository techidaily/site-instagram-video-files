 Understanding what types of content will attract the most attention from your Instagram followers is easy with Keyhole. The suite of optimization data this Instagram analytics tool offers will enable you to time your Instagram posts perfectly and it will also inform you which hashtags are best suited for your Instagram posts.

 Although the free trial is available, the pricing plans for this Instagram analytics tool start at $179 per month. Keyhole may be expensive, but its features make it a great option for big agencies and large social media marketing teams.

#### 7\. [Sprout Social](https://sproutsocial.com/)

 Sprout Social combines analytics tools with the tools you can use to schedule posts on several different social media platforms, including Instagram. It is probably not best suited for small marketing teams because its features were designed to improve the workflow of large companies and teams that need to manage large databases. Its price suggests the same, since the cheapest version of Sprout Social you can get costs $99, while the most expensive option for enterprises costs $249.
