Let's first have a brief discussion on Instagram's different aspect ratios for Stories, Reels, IGTV, and so on. Even though 95 million photos are being posted every day on Instagram, the video stats still perform better. The video posts tend to receive two times more comments than other kinds of posts.

For Instagram videos, you've to check around its five minimum or maximum resolution requirements based upon where and how you will post them.

Minimum Resolution: 600 × 600; Maximum Resolution: 1080 × 1080

* **Stories Videos**

Minimum Resolution: 600 × 1067; Maximum Resolution: 1080 × 1920

* **Landscape Videos**

Minimum Resolution: 600 × 315; Maximum Resolution: 1080 × 608

* **Carousel Videos**

Minimum Resolution: 600 × 700; Maximum Resolution: 1080 × 1080

Given below are **different aspect ratios of Instagram Videos**.

* Square - 1:1
* Portrait - 4:5
* Stories – 9:16
* Landscape – 1.91: 1 to 16:9
* Carousel – 1:1; 4:5; 16:9
