 **Step 1:** Make sure that you have Wondershare Filmora installed, if not, please click the free download button above to start. Once it is downloaded, launch the app.

Since we’re sharing looping videos to Instagram, let’s set up the project aspect ratio to 9:16 first and then import the video by clicking on the plus icon in the middle of the interface to add footage or photos.

 **Step 2:** Now, drag and drop the footage to the timeline, and then copy the video from the timeline by pressing Ctrl + C and then paste the video in the timeline as much time as you want to loop by pressing Ctrl + V.

 **Step 3:** To add music into the looping video, drag and drop the music file into the timeline and trim it according to the size of the video.

 **Step 4:** You can also add some elements, titles, or transitions to the looping video to make the looping much fun. At last, click Export and save it as MP4 or MOV format, share it with your Instagram or any desired social media platform.
