This feature becomes beneficial for people who are hard of hearing. Not just this, the caption feature is also ideal for people who find an interesting Story or Reel but don’t want to disturb the people around them by turning on the volume.

## Part 6: Why You Should Add Captions on Instagram Stories and Reels?

Captions allow everyone to understand what you are saying in the video. Brands and companies, in particular, should create an all-inclusive ecosystem so that whoever watches the video understands right away the purpose of creating it.

The caption feature is one of the most anticipated features of Instagram and is praise-worthy for including everyone. Captions work both ways; it works as a subtitle for people who want to be sure that whatever you are saying in the Reel or Story is getting digested accurately, and it works as a text guide for people who are have hearing loss issues. Moreover, for people who don’t want to turn on the volume when they are in a quiet place, captions allow them to enjoy the video nevertheless.

Captions, in general, make the video story or reel watching experience better and convenient. However, if you are a brand, influencer, or company, and want to reach out to more people, add captions!

Instagram keeps bringing something new to its platform and for all good reasons. The latest one that is garnering a lot of attention is captioning for Instagram stories and reels. This feature will let viewers watch a Story or Reel without having the need to turn on their volume. Instead, the caption will display whatever is being talked about in the short video.

This feature becomes beneficial for people who are hard of hearing. Not just this, the caption feature is also ideal for people who find an interesting Story or Reel but don’t want to disturb the people around them by turning on the volume. Instagram rolled out this feature for Stories first, and then it was launched for Reels. Now, let’s find out how to use the **Instagram auto caption** feature.

[![Download Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)[![Download Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

## Part 1: How to Add Captions to Your Instagram Stories Automatically?

Auto-generated captions on Instagram are easy to add. However, there’s one thing that you need to know. The caption feature is available **only for English-speaking countries** and not everywhere else. Therefore, if you can see the caption feature on your Instagram, it means it is available for you, and if you can’t, try updating it once. And even after updating Instagram, if you still can’t find the caption option, it means it’s not available in your country. So, the steps that we have mentioned below is for those countries that have caption feature available in their Instagram app.

**Step 1:** First, log in to your Instagram account and click on your profile picture with the + sign. Click on the Story option and start recording something and keep talking.

![record instagram story](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/record-instagram-story-add-caption.png)

**Step 2:** Once done, you need to click on the emoticon option that you can see on the top of the screen.

You will see a list of stickers. From the list, you need to select Captions. There will be multiple formats available for the captions; choose one that you like.

![instagram  captions sticker](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/instagram-captions-sticker.png)

And that’s about it. The **Instagram auto-generated captions** will begin to display every word that you are saying in your Story.

![instagram  captions  auto](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-auto-captions-instagram.png)

## Part 2: How to Add Captions on Your Instagram Reels Automatically?

**Text-to-speech Instagram reels** will work the same way as Story. The only difference is, you will have to select Reel and not Story while recording your short video. Here are the steps:

**Step 1:** Go to your Instagram account and click on your profile with the + sign.

Once the camera appears, click on the Reels option.

![  instagram reels](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/access-instagram-reels.png)

**Step 2:** Start recording something, and don’t forget to speak while you record. Once done, click on the sticker option and choose the caption.

The sticker page will open multiple stickers. Out of them, you need to choose captions.

## Part 3: How to Add Captions to Instagram Video with Text Tool manually?

As we said, the caption feature may not be available in every country. And currently, Instagram has rolled out this feature only in English-speaking countries. So, what will non-English speaking countries do? Well, there’s an easy solution. You can add text to your Story or Reel manually. Follow the following steps:

**Step 1:** Click on Instagram Story or Reel to create a story and record something. Say something while recording and complete your recording process. Now, click on the text icon on the top.

![  instagram manually add caption](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/instagram-stories-add-captions-option.png)

**Step 2:** Begin writing whatever you have said in the video and done. While the Story starts playing, the text will appear as well.

## Part 4: Top 3 Free Instagram Caption Generator Apps for Various Captions

If you are looking for Instagram caption generator apps that will automatically add text to your videos, which you can later post on your Instagram post, stories, and reels, here are the top three free Instagram caption generator apps that will make your life easy.

1. Captions for Instagram and Facebook photos 2021 from Caption Plus

Our first pick is Caption Plus. This lightweight app has over 15 caption categories, more than 1 million pieces of captions, the latest and trending hashtags, and the best the captions are AI-based, which means lesser chances of caption error.

![  instagram  caption apps](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/caption-plus-app.png)

Caption Plus allows you to create captivating videos and offer you quickly matched captions that you may like. Moreover, hashtags are added automatically so that your videos can be seen by more people, provided you have kept your profile public. You can download this caption generator on your Android device.

### 2\. Caption Pro

![  instagram  caption apps](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/caption-pro-app-for-instagram.png)

One good thing about Caption Pro is that it shows you the latest emojis and hashtags that will go well with your video. Just browse through the 70+ Instagram caption categories and pick one that suits your requirements. This caption generation is available for Android both.

![  instagram  caption apps](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/captionIit-app-ios-android.png)

It enables you to drag the caption anywhere in the video, change the background, and even share the caption-generated video instantly on Instagram. This app is available for Android and iOS users.

## Part 5: What Are Captions? And How Are They Different from Subtitles?

Although captions and subtitles may sound the same, both of them have different purposes to solve. You apply a caption to your videos that will allow hearing-impaired people to understand what you are saying in your video.

However, subtitles can be for any language. They are text for a language in a video that others may not understand. So, in a caption, you can see the video but can’t hear the audio. In the subtitle, you can see and hear both but can’t understand the language.

## Part 6: Why You Should Add Captions on Instagram Stories and Reels?

Captions allow everyone to understand what you are saying in the video. Brands and companies, in particular, should create an all-inclusive ecosystem so that whoever watches the video understands right away the purpose of creating it. Since there are many people with hearing problems, not adding captions to stories and reels would mean discarding them.

The caption feature is one of the most anticipated features of Instagram and is praise-worthy for including everyone. Captions work both ways; it works as a subtitle for people who want to be sure that whatever you are saying in the Reel or Story is getting digested accurately, and it works as a text guide for people who are have hearing loss issues. Moreover, for people who don’t want to turn on the volume when they are in a quiet place, captions allow them to enjoy the video nevertheless.

Captions, in general, make the video story or reel watching experience better and convenient. However, if you are a brand, influencer, or company, and want to reach out to more people, add captions!
