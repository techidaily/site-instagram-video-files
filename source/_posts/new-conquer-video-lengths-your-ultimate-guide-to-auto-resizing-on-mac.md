Yes, the video posting on Instagram can offer you significant merits in this digital age of video marketing. The first reason that more and more brands are using video marketing strategies on Instagram is the broad reach. The Instagram algorithm gets activated when reach and engagement on your Instagram account increases. So, why not keep up with what's trending? And, if you're keeping up, you may be confronting the difficulty of switching the same video into different sizes for respective social media channels. Even if your brand is present on at least two social media channels, it's worth considering how to **resize video for Instagram**.

Without further ado, let’s get started with our instant and automatic solution on video resizing for Instagram as follows.

## Part 1: How to Auto Resize Videos for Instagram Stories, Feed, and IGTV on Mac?

Let's first have a brief discussion on Instagram's different aspect ratios for Stories, Reels, IGTV, and so on. Even though 95 million photos are being posted every day on Instagram, the video stats still perform better. The video posts tend to receive two times more comments than other kinds of posts.

For Instagram videos, you've to check around its five minimum or maximum resolution requirements based upon where and how you will post them.

* **Portrait Videos**

Minimum Resolution: 600 × 750; Maximum Resolution: 1080 × 1350

* **Square Videos**

Minimum Resolution: 600 × 600; Maximum Resolution: 1080 × 1080

* **Stories Videos**

Minimum Resolution: 600 × 1067; Maximum Resolution: 1080 × 1920

* **Landscape Videos**

Minimum Resolution: 600 × 315; Maximum Resolution: 1080 × 608

* **Carousel Videos**

Minimum Resolution: 600 × 700; Maximum Resolution: 1080 × 1080

Given below are **different aspect ratios of Instagram Videos**.

* Square - 1:1
* Portrait - 4:5
* Stories – 9:16
* Landscape – 1.91: 1 to 16:9
* Carousel – 1:1; 4:5; 16:9
