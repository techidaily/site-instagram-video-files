Alternatively, you can just have a text overlay that displays your URL, though, it is not clickable. Future updates might support sharing links on Instagram Stories for all.

**Step 1** â€“ Take a shot or record a video using the Instagram Stories camera or select a recently (within 24 hours) clicked photo by swiping the screen up.

**Step 2** â€“ Now, tap the chain icon from the top right corner of the screen and enter the desired URL. Select the tick mark on the top right corner of the Instagram Story window.
