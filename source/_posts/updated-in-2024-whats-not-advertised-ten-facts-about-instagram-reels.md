### #5\. People in the US and India use Instagram Reels most

India and the US have been the most responsive to Instagram Reels. Much of this credit goes to the governments of these countries. In December 2019, Trump tried to get TikTok banned.

Introducing the chat feature, stories, IGTV, and its most recent update of the Instagram Reels, Instagram continues to seize the market. It is now the sixth most popular social media platform with more than one billion active users.
