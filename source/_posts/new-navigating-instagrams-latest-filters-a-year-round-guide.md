## Part 4: How to Add Filters on Instagram Reels?

Instagram Reels are very similar to TikTok videos, with the iconic feature of uploading entertaining short fifteen-second videos as Instagram Reels. Instagram reels are one of the most prominent features of the new updated version of the Instagram Application.

## Part 5: How to Organize the Instagram Filters for Post/Reels/Feed?

Instagram is a great application that offers a wide range of filters to its users. Even though it's a great feature and very beneficial for the users to choose among the variety, it can be annoying to skim through the long list to find a specific filter. For that sole reason, Instagram provides the user with the option to hide certain filters or rearrange them to find a filter of your preference easily.

The steps below are a guide to organizing the filters for your Instagram Post/Reels/Feed.

**Step 1: Tap on Manage Option**

The initial step is to select or capture a photo/video. Go to the filters screen and scroll to the end of the list to tap on the **Manage** option. It is a settings option specifically for the filters feature.

**Step 2: Rearrange or Hide Filters**

For rearranging your filters, hold and drag the three lines on the left side of the specified filter to wherever you want it to be. As for hiding a specific filter, tap on the circle present at the right side of the filter. When the tick sign disappears and the color of the title of the filter fades, it means that the filter has been hidden.

**Note:** Another way to rearrange or hide filters is to do it from the filters screen. Long press on the specified filter and drag it to the position you want it to be. And drop the filter on the **Drag to hide** option to hide the selected filter. You can always turn off this feature from the manage menu.

But don't panic! In this article, we have talked about the nitty-gritty on **how to use filters on Insta**. And that's about it on how to use filters on Instagram.
