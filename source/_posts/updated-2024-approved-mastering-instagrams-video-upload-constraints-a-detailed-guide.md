Since Instagram's debut in 2010, it has become one of the most popular social media platforms globally. The app is optimized for mobile devices which are perfect for today's technological age. Users love communicating via high-quality pictures and videos with their friends and followers.

As users demand more ways to communicate, Instagram has been including additional features but with some limitations, requiring them to go through a complicated procedure to accomplish their goals such as uploading longer videos.

Instagrammers can capture videos, share them via direct message or on their account, and post them as a story. Unfortunately, these videos come with time limits. The length of the Instagram video depends on the type of content users wish to upload. Here’s a breakdown of the video length requirements for different types.

* **Instagram Stories Limits:** Videos are limited to 15 seconds. However, users can create multiple clips and share them as combined stories for longer than 15 seconds.

* **Instagram Live Broadcast Limits:** Live broadcast videos have a limit of up to 60 minutes maximum.

5. If your friends accept the invitation to join, they will appear on the split-screen view
6. To remove the person you’ve invited, tap “Cancel” at the top right corner of the screen

### Method 2: Use Filmora X to Reduce Video Size

Using apps like Filmora X is one of the best ways to edit longer videos in different ways. If you want to upload a video of more than 30-minutes on Instagram, consider using the feature smart video size reducer on Filmora X on Mac without losing video quality.

From the different video formats, bit rate, and quality to reduce video file size, you can easily cut down the video size following the below-listed steps.

## Section 1. How to Upload a Video Longer than 60-Seconds to Instagram?

* Method 1: Share in the form of Multiple Video Clips
* Method 2: Use Third-Party APP- Filmora X- to Shorten Videos

Users who want to upload videos on Instagram as a post or story have restricted time limits as mentioned above. While the 60-seconds time limit may not be enough for some videos, users can get around these issues and post longer videos on Instagram using a few creative hacks.

### Method 1: Share Multiple Video Clips to Instagram on MAC

Since users are bound to a limit, Instagram videos can be composed of multiple clips. You can create longer videos for Instagram by looping multiple video clips together and uploading them. Follow the below steps to do so:

1\. Open Instagram on Safari > Click "View">"Developer">"Developer Tools"

3\. Once the page change to mobile view, you can upload the multiple videos to Instagram from Mac, just like you upload it from a mobile phone.

In addition to sharing the video in multiple video clips, you can also use editors to trim down your videos and reduce their time limit. In this way, you will have abridged clips that you can easily upload to Instagram.

### Method 2: Use Third-Party App–[Filmora X](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)–to Shorten Videos

## Section 2. How to Upload a Video Longer than 30-Minutes to Instagram?

Sometimes a few seconds or minutes’ videos don't fulfill the purpose. Users like sharing every detail of the event happening around them therefore their videos may be longer than 30 minutes. Here are two easy methods to share lengthy videos with your followers.

* Method 1: Share a Live Video
* Method 2: Use Filmora X to Reduce Video Size

### Method 1: Share a Live Video on Instagram

Live videos have up to 1-hour extended video limit. Instead of recording and uploading a video as a post, you can share it as a live video instead. Since these live videos are temporary, Instagram has now introduced replays for your followers for 24 hours as soon as you finish recording them. This means your live video plays the same as an Instagram story, appearing beside the followers' Instagram feed.

Let’s explore the steps to share a live video with friends.

1. Swipe right from anywhere in the Feed or tap the camera icon on the top left of the screen
2. Click “Live” at the bottom of the screen then record
3. Tap Friends with smiley icons
4. Choose the person’s name to invite them to join your live video and add more friends accordingly
5. If your friends accept the invitation to join, they will appear on the split-screen view
6. To remove the person you’ve invited, tap “Cancel” at the top right corner of the screen

### Method 2: Use Filmora X to Reduce Video Size

Using apps like Filmora X is one of the best ways to edit longer videos in different ways. If you want to upload a video of more than 30-minutes on Instagram, consider using the feature smart video size reducer on Filmora X on Mac without losing video quality.

From the different video formats, bit rate, and quality to reduce video file size, you can easily cut down the video size following the below-listed steps.

1. Import the video files to the user’s album
2. Cut off the unwanted video clips
3. Change the settings, export the file in the required format, and save on Mac
