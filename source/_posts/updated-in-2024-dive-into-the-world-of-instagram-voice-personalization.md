## Part 2: Types of Instagram Voice Filters

There are five voice filters available. Each of them is unique, and depending on your mood and requirements, you can pick a voice filter.

**Helium:** The first voice filter is helium. It makes your voice sound as if you have inhaled the helium gas. As a result, your voice will sound squishy and cute.

Giant: If you love a giant voice, try the giant voice because it will make you sound completely different!

**Vocalist:** The vocalist filter makes your voice sound incredibly soothing and melodic. If you like soft voice, this is the filter to go for.

**Announcer:** The announcer filter will let you speak like a real announcer. It has echo effects too!

**Robot:** The last one is the robot filter, where you will sound like a robot. This one makes you sound like you are from outer space.
