### 2\. Talk to them directly

You need to initiate talks with Instagram influencers for Instagram promotions. Influencers consume the product and if satisfied ask the brand to promote it. Sometimes there is no direct partnership between the influencer and the brand to promote a product.

You can approach an influencer to try your new product and review it on Instagram or work as joint fundraisers like contests and lucky draws. Genuine influencers who use your product and product voluntarily are really helpful for you.

### 3\. Great platform is a shortcut

Instagram influencers consider that an influencer platform is the ultimate way to get in touch with brands. Such a platform offers a third-party neutral arena for meeting brands. You can discover new influencers and they can find you as well. A sense of security is there for both parties, as there are certain terms of use governed by the platform.

## Part 3: Benefits of promoting Instagram post

### 1\. Higher Conversion Rates

Softer engagements like registration for content or resource downloading garner better conversion rate through Instagram Ads. In case of purchasing also the rate of conversion is identical. Visually engaging product Ads generate more purchases and enhance your ROI.

### 2\. Instagram is connected with Facebook

This fact makes a great impact on Instagram promotion, because Facebook data can be utilized to target your Instagram audience. As the scheduling and budgeting exercises, creating and setting up Ads is managed through Facebook, you don’t have to repeat it for Instagram.

### 3\. It targets millennial generation

Creating and promoting Instagram posts for Instagram Ads targeting the millennial generation is the best solution. As more young people below the age of 30 years are avid Instagram users. Grabbing their attention and winning their trust would ensure high engagement on your Instagram account.
