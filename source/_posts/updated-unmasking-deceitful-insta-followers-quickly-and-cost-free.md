### 2\. Check Profile Sections

 Usually, the fake Instagram followers do not put much effort into creating an appealing profile, and neither do they have a realistic bio. They might even leave the bio space empty or fill in minimum details.

 Your profile check becomes tough when the fake followers turn their profile settings to hidden. It is obvious that the one who hides their profile, can it be authentic? Can you get a loyal and committed follower with such fake Instagram followers? Such profiles instantly get a red flag.

### 3\. Check Engagement

 The [engagement rate](https://blog.hootsuite.com/calculate-engagement-rate/) must be proportional to the number of followers in your influencer’s account. The brands can calculate if the engagement rate is proportionate to the number of followers by comparing the number of comments and likes to the number of followers.

 The Instagram accounts that have several followers but a very low engagement rate are usually considered to have several fake Instagram followers. For calculating the engagement rate of any account, you may pick last uploaded ten photos and take out the average number of comments and likes garnered on those images. Then, divide the average number by several followers and, finally, multiply it by 10\. Even if you find the engagement rate satisfying, check out if the comments and likes are real or purchased.

### 4\. Using Third-Party Tools

 If you feel that calculating manually is not the best thing to do, you can also find some tools that can help you to determine if the followers of your influencer are fake.
