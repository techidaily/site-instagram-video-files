#### Create your bang

You must grab the user's attention quickly by giving a sort of bang in the initial seconds.

The idea is not to create random stuff but to target the specific users according to your niche so that the videos get noticed and ranked well.

#### Competitor Research

The competitor research is another borrowed feature from TikTok, where you can check out various brands and social media influencers about what they are creating. It’s a great way to find trending hashtags as well.

#### Check your existing metrics

If you ever analyzed TikTok accounts of big influencers, they show up a fair amount of overall metrics, including video content. Keep an eye on your Instagram bio and check if it has the right amount of words and a call to action. You can consider other factors of metrics as the ideal post timing and use of specific hashtags etc.

#### Trigger people to comment on

You can include some random details also so that people get induced to comment on your Instagram Reels. These unexpected details can be anything such as mentioning some weird stuff or writing great captions etc.

#### Be Relatable

Being relatable is the most crucial tip to go viral over Instagram. Don't show off and be real; it's the most critical way to win the hearts even on any platform. Well, being relatable also means to be hateable, inspirational, or aspirational.

### Conclusion

So, this is how to use Instagram Reels and its related viral marketing strategies. Well, we haven’t ignored TikTok while talking about Instagram Reels due to a correlation between both the platforms, as discussed above. Thus, the viral marketing strategies used on TikTok are wholly applicable here as well.
