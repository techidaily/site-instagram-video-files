The giant social network that is Instagram has never been more popular and is a hub of more than 40 billion photos and videos, with 95 million more being shared every day. Sometimes you might see an image or video you'd like to save for later or to use as wallpaper on your device.

If you're an Apple user, you'll already know it's not quite as simple as you might think to **save Instagram photos to iPhone and iPad devices**. Whether it's a copyright issue or simply that they want you on the app, Instagram doesn't let Apple devices download content from within the app itself, which can be frustrating if you see something you'd like to view again later.

If you've been wondering how to save Instagram photos on your iPhone, we've got just the tutorial for you. Here, we'll investigate a few different methods of getting those gorgeous images from the app and saving them to your camera roll, without tearing your hair out in the process.

The giant social network that is Instagram has never been more popular and is a hub of more than 40 billion photos and videos, with 95 million more being shared every day. Sometimes you might see an image or video you'd like to save for later or to use as wallpaper on your device.

If you're an Apple user, you'll already know it's not quite as simple as you might think to **save Instagram photos to iPhone and iPad devices**. Whether it's a copyright issue or simply that they want you on the app, Instagram doesn't let Apple devices download content from within the app itself, which can be frustrating if you see something you'd like to view again later.

If you've been wondering how to save Instagram photos on your iPhone, we've got just the tutorial for you. Here, we'll investigate a few different methods of getting those gorgeous images from the app and saving them to your camera roll, without tearing your hair out in the process.

If you need to save Instagram photos, iPhone users will need a workaround. There are a few different solutions to the problem of how to save Instagram photos to camera roll, and here we'll delve into three of the most popular solutions around.

* [Method 1: Download Instagram Photos via a URL](#part1)
* [Method 2: App Solutions](#part2)
* [Method 3: Jailbreak tweaks](#part3)

### Method 1: Download Instagram Photos via a URL

One of the ways to save Instagram photos on iPhone is by using the URL of the image you want. It's a tried and tested solution, although not that elegant, it works and it's not that hard to do. Here's how to save Instagram photos on iPhone using the URL bar:

* Open Instagram and navigate to the photo you wish to download
* Tap the three dots in the top right corner of your screen
* Select 'copy share URL'

* Tap save image
* Your image is now in your camera roll

We said it wasn't going to be easy, but it certainly works. It might seem like a cumbersome method, but to **save Instagram photos on iPhone** users need to be a little tenacious about the process. Try it yourself, and once you've been through the process a few times it will be second nature. Of course, if you like something a little more intuitive, try our app-based solution below.

### Method 2: App solution

There are many apps for that. These apps have been created to end the hassles of how to save Instagram photos to the camera roll on your phone. Here's how to do it:

* Find a [Reposting App for Instagram](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) on the App Store and download it to your device
* Log in to the app using your Instagram username and password
* Navigate to the image you'd like to save to your iPhone
* You'll notice a new icon in the bottom corner which looks like a square with an arrow; this is the 'share' button. Go ahead and tap it now.
* Tap on 'repost' to start the download process
* Tap on 'repost' again to confirm
* Now you have your photo or video from Instagram right there in your camera roll

It works with video too, but you'll need to select the video in your camera roll and paste it in the caption if you wish to include this also.

### Method 3: Jailbreak tweaks

If you've got your hands on a jailbroken device and are wondering how to save Instagram photos on iPhones that are free from the Apple restrictions, there are some tweaks you can download to enable you to do this. On Cyadia, for example, you can select from a number of apps such as Instagram++, InstaEnhancer, and InstaTools, all of which will let you download Instagram photos on iPhone with ease.
