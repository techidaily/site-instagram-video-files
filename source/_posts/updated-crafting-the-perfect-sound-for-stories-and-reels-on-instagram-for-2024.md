## Part 2: Types of Instagram Voice Filters

There are five voice filters available. Each of them is unique, and depending on your mood and requirements, you can pick a voice filter.

**Helium:** The first voice filter is helium. It makes your voice sound as if you have inhaled the helium gas. As a result, your voice will sound squishy and cute.

Giant: If you love a giant voice, try the giant voice because it will make you sound completely different!

**Vocalist:** The vocalist filter makes your voice sound incredibly soothing and melodic. If you like soft voice, this is the filter to go for.

**Announcer:** The announcer filter will let you speak like a real announcer. It has echo effects too!

**Robot:** The last one is the robot filter, where you will sound like a robot. This one makes you sound like you are from outer space.

## Part 2: Types of Instagram Voice Filters

There are five voice filters available. Each of them is unique, and depending on your mood and requirements, you can pick a voice filter.

**Helium:** The first voice filter is helium. It makes your voice sound as if you have inhaled the helium gas. As a result, your voice will sound squishy and cute.

Giant: If you love a giant voice, try the giant voice because it will make you sound completely different!

**Vocalist:** The vocalist filter makes your voice sound incredibly soothing and melodic. If you like soft voice, this is the filter to go for.

**Announcer:** The announcer filter will let you speak like a real announcer. It has echo effects too!

**Robot:** The last one is the robot filter, where you will sound like a robot. This one makes you sound like you are from outer space.

## Part 3: How to Change Voice in Instagram Reel?

Just like you can change your voice when filming a story, you can try the same voice-changing filter while recording a reel. Since Reels stay on your account, it makes sense to transform your usual reels into something extraordinary, and the voice changer effect helps you achieve that impeccably. Here’s what you need to do:

**Step 1:** Go to your Instagram account and click on your profile picture with the + icon. And then click on the Reels option.

![create Instagram Reels](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/create-instagram-reels.jpg)

**Step 2:** On your left, you will see the filter option; please click on that. When the filters appear, look at the top of the filters, and you will see a search bar. There, you need to type voice effects.

![add voice effect in Instagram Reels](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-voice-effects-instagram-reels.jpg)
