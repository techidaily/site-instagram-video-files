Thus, to edit vertical video for Instagram in Final Cut Pro X, all you need is to follow the steps given below. We have also covered how to export vertical videos for Instagram in FCPX without black bars.

**Step 1: Start a new project**

To start a new Final Cut Pro project, go to “File > New > Project”.

Now, you need to optimize the media. We mostly recommend you reach the interface like below to enter the project name, location, etc.

Whereby, tapping the “Use Custom Settings” option, you can access further options like resolution wherefrom the video dropdown, choose the **Custom** option, and set the resolution. Once optimized, tap **OK**.

**Step 2: Import media files**

Now, you can import the shorter videos shot on your smartphone by “File > Import > Media”.

**Step 3: Transform the video**

Once imported, take them to the timeline. If you don’t wish to crop the horizontal video, you can rotate it to click the “Transform” option under the video inspector icon.

**Step 4: Rotate the video**

You will now get the rotated markers. By using them, you can rotate the video 90 degrees.

If you wish the video to fill the entire frame without any color bars, then you can drag the pointer and expand the video and scale it.

**Step 5: Export the video**

If you finish the vertical video editing, then it’s time to export or save the video, and here is how to export vertical videos for Instagram in FCPX.
