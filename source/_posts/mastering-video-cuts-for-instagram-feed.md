How do you cut the length of a video on Instagram?

The two ways of shortening the video are “split’ and “speed up.” Instagram has built-in features that cut video length automatically when you upload them. The length limits are;

* Instagram stories, it’s **15 seconds.**
* Instagram feed, it’s **3 to 60 seconds.**
* IGTV, it’s between **15 seconds to 10 minutes** for non-verified accounts. For verified accounts, it gets cut at 60 minutes.

This article will teach you the two ways to cut the length of a video on Mac before you upload it on Instagram.
