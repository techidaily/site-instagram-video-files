## Part 1: Before Instagram Posting

 To schedule Instagram posts or use the posting management tools, you need to have a business profile on Instagram.

 You may find out if your Insta profile is set to business or personal by going to the settings page and check for options to switch from business to personal profile and personal to business profiles. Tap on the switch on the public profile option and once its done, connect it to your Facenook account.

 You must ensure all your information provided in your FB page is accurate before connecting the Insta with the FB as many information from Facebook is added to the Instagram profile as well. When you use the 3rd party social media tools, some of the Instagram posting features might be missing.

 For instance, some of the 3rd party Instagram scheduling tool may not allow you to tag location or user while posting photos. Video posting may not be allowed with Instagram scheduling tool. So, reviewing the pros and cons of the Instagram scheduler is a must prior to using it.
