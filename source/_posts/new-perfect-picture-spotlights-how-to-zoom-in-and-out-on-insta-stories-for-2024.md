We are sure that the methods mentioned above have made you learn capturing videos in zoom in a quick and easy way. But, it's up to you to decide the best speed while capturing and customizing the video content to make it stand out.

Understanding not only how to zoom in Instagram Stories, but also knowing how to edit it with the right background music will make them more appealing.
