#### Tips for Cropping Videos Using Filmora

Here are a few things you might want to keep in mind when cropping videos for Instagram using Filmora.

\* Portrait (4:3)

To create a video clip with a portrait aspect ratio, you have to crop it. Filmora has a tool that will help you do this; it's located in the viewer panel, and you can access it by clicking on the Crop Pan button. An online aspect ratio calculator will help you calculate pixel dimension and aspect ratio to ensure they match.

Now, go back to the Filmora video editing software and navigate to the Crop and Pan screen. You need to click the Manual option and manually type in the number to resize your video.

Adjust the position of the crop tool and then hit the OK button. Keep in mind that the export process for a portrait and landscape video is almost similar; however, you have to change the resolution. You can do this by clicking the Resolution drop-down menu and choosing the custom option. Insert the weight and height values you entered in the cropping tool and export the video.

\* Square (1:1)

To create a square video for Instagram, you'll need to follow the same process as that of creating portrait videos; however, make sure that the weight and height values are the same. Once this is done, you need to adjust the crop rectangle to ensure it's in the correct position before clicking the OK button.

The process for exporting videos is similar to that of portrait videos. Before clicking the Export button, be sure to adjust the resolution of your video to 1080X1080.

\* Landscape (16:9)

Videos recorded by cameras record are often in the landscape aspect ratio. As such, before exporting your video, be sure to check the frame rate and resolution of the video clip you would like to export. In the media panel, right-click on your video clip and select Properties. Once you find these details, hit the Export button.

A new window will pop up; hit the Format icon on the upper left side of your screen. Choose the MP4 format and name the video file. Don't forget to specify the location you would like to export the file.

Click Settings and set the Quality of your video by choosing the Best option. Now, you need to select an HD format located in the Encoder menu.

It is time to select the Frame rate and Resolution matching the ones in the video clip. Navigate to the Audio Settings and change the Bitrate to 128 Kbps. Once you have done this, click on the OK button. You can now upload your video on Instagram and share it with your followers.

#### Tips for Cropping Videos Using Filmora

Here are a few things you might want to keep in mind when cropping videos for Instagram using Filmora.

\* Portrait (4:3)

To create a video clip with a portrait aspect ratio, you have to crop it. Filmora has a tool that will help you do this; it's located in the viewer panel, and you can access it by clicking on the Crop Pan button. An online aspect ratio calculator will help you calculate pixel dimension and aspect ratio to ensure they match.

Now, go back to the Filmora video editing software and navigate to the Crop and Pan screen. You need to click the Manual option and manually type in the number to resize your video.

Adjust the position of the crop tool and then hit the OK button. Keep in mind that the export process for a portrait and landscape video is almost similar; however, you have to change the resolution. You can do this by clicking the Resolution drop-down menu and choosing the custom option. Insert the weight and height values you entered in the cropping tool and export the video.

\* Square (1:1)

To create a square video for Instagram, you'll need to follow the same process as that of creating portrait videos; however, make sure that the weight and height values are the same. Once this is done, you need to adjust the crop rectangle to ensure it's in the correct position before clicking the OK button.

The process for exporting videos is similar to that of portrait videos. Before clicking the Export button, be sure to adjust the resolution of your video to 1080X1080.

\* Landscape (16:9)

Videos recorded by cameras record are often in the landscape aspect ratio. As such, before exporting your video, be sure to check the frame rate and resolution of the video clip you would like to export. In the media panel, right-click on your video clip and select Properties. Once you find these details, hit the Export button.

A new window will pop up; hit the Format icon on the upper left side of your screen. Choose the MP4 format and name the video file. Don't forget to specify the location you would like to export the file.

Click Settings and set the Quality of your video by choosing the Best option. Now, you need to select an HD format located in the Encoder menu.

It is time to select the Frame rate and Resolution matching the ones in the video clip. Navigate to the Audio Settings and change the Bitrate to 128 Kbps. Once you have done this, click on the OK button. You can now upload your video on Instagram and share it with your followers.
