 Posting new photos to Instagram every day can dry up your pool of ideas pretty quickly. Coming up with new topics for photos that will keep your followers interested and entertained is essential if you want your Instagram profile to attract thousands of likes on a daily basis.

 We've gathered some ideas that might inspire you to create photos that will take Instagram by storm, so let's start discovering different ways of keeping your followers interested while attracting the attention of new Instagrammers.

## Top 20 Inspiring Instagram Photos Ideas

 Keeping an open mind and approaching each idea with a fresh pair of eyes will help you achieve better results, whichever idea from the list below you choose to explore.

* **Cityscapes and Landscapes**

 There is absolutely no doubt that people love beautiful landscapes, and they often don't feel shy about showing it. The same goes for gorgeous city scenes captured on rainy nights or early in the morning on your way to work.

* **Inspirational Quotes**

 Life can be hard, and we all look for inspiration wherever we can find it. Posting inspirational quotes on your Instagram profile can be a great way to inspire others, especially if you post quotes that are directly related to the topic your profile is covering.

* **Combine several photos into a single Instagram post**

 A picture is worth a thousand words, but not all stories can be told with a single picture. Combining a few photos that tell the stories you want your followers to see, can be a very efficient way of promoting your products or letting your friends know about your latest adventure.

* **Selfies**

 Selfies have lost a lot of the popularity they had a couple of years ago, but this doesn't mean that taking a creative selfie on an amazing location isn't an awesome Instagram photo idea.

* **Important events from your life**

 Graduating from college, getting the first job, being promoted or moving to another country are all important steps in life, and sharing them with your friends on Instagram will surely help you get a lot of likes.

* **Animals doing adorable things**

 Pets are like children, we all get attached to them pretty quickly, so why not introduce your furry companions to the Instagram community. Besides, you'll probably be able to get some amazing shots just by paying attention to the day your pet is having.

* **Animate your Instagram profile with Boomerang**

 The Instagram's Boomerang feature is fun to use because it brings a motion to otherwise mostly static profile. The best part is that Boomerang can be used both for professional purposes and entertainment, with an equal amount of success.

* **Product Shots**

 Online entrepreneurs, as well as big companies, can use Instagram photos as a creative way of familiarizing their potential clients with products and services they are offering. Posting pictures on Instagram should be a part of every online marketing campaign because you never know who is going to stumble upon your photo.

* **Hilarious GIFs**

 People never forget how you made them feel, so making them laugh is always a good idea. GIFs are incredibly popular and very easy to make, so using your creative energy to cheer up your business associates and friends may help you increase traffic on your Instagram profile. However, you'll need to have an app that enables you to post GIFs to Instagram, since the platform doesn't support GIF files.

* **Delicious Food**

 We all love to eat, which is why pics of delicious food are never a bad idea. However, it goes without saying that taking a photo of every snack you lay your eyes on should probably be avoided . Post only food pics that offer something more than a view of a spaghetti bowl.

* **Yoga Poses**

 Taking care of your body means that you are taking care of your mind. Yoga is currently one of the most popular recreational activities in the world, and if you know a few good Yoga poses you shouldn't hesitate to share them.

* **Photos of a venue**

 This Instagram photo idea works best for cafes, bars or restaurants, although all other types of venues can spark a lot of interest. What's more, musicians who are playing at several different places in a single week can use these types of shots to promote their gigs.

* **Close-up shots**

 You can take close-ups of literally anything, however, it is important to take these types of shot in situations that are somehow related to the most important subjects your Instagram account covers. Close-ups are a great choice if you want to appear professional, and add an artistic touch to your Instagram photos.

* **Take shots that show your thankfulness**

 Show how much you appreciate the support your followers are giving you. You'll make them feel involved and as a part of the success, your Instagram profile is enjoying.

* **A sneak peek of a new project you're working on**

 Nothing sparks interest like a sneak peek shot of a project you are just starting. This Instagram photo idea is a perfect bait for comments and is best used if you want to promote your upcoming project.

* **Tell your Instagram followers all about your hobby**

 Make things personal, and let your friends know how you like to spend your free time. Hiking, making origami sculptures or reading make great topics for photos, and they give your followers an insight into your life.

* **Offer a good tip**

 Life hacks can be precious because they offer us a faster and simpler way of doing things. Even if you made a horrible mistake, offering a useful tip will prevent your followers from repeating the same mistake and offer them a way to improve their lives.

* **Explore new angles**

 Sometimes all we need is a fresh approach to things. The same can be said for Instagram photo ideas because just changing the angle from which you take photos can offer a new perspective on the topic you are covering.

* **Show the world what you really stand for**

 Sharing corporate values or standing up for the causes you really believe in can get you a lot of sympathy on Instagram. Take photos that reflect the values you stand for, and you'll see how many people share the same values.

* **Share your achievements**

 Nothing motivates like success since we all love to watch success stories unfold in front of our eyes. Each of your achievements can inspire others to do great things, so don't hesitate to use them as an idea for your Instagram photos.
