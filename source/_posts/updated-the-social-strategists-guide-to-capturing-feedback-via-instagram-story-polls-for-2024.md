## How to Create an Instagram Story Poll: A Step by Step Approach

Now when you know how important Instagram polls can be, let’s quickly learn how to do a poll on Instagram. To post Instagram poll questions, you simply need an active Instagram account. You can post an Instagram poll for your entire audience to see, set selective audience, or even DM it to someone. To learn how to do a poll on Instagram, just follow these steps:

#### 1\. Create your Instagram Story

At first, you can simply launch Instagram on your phone and go to the Story feature from the top-left corner. Once the dedicated interface of Instagram Story is launched, go to the “Create” section from its home to come up with an Instagram poll.

On the Create panel, simply swipe up to get options to insert questions, polls, countdowns, and so on. From here, tap on the “Poll” option, and its widget would be added on the screen that you can easily move around to position.

![Tap Poll Option](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/tap-poll-option.jpg)

Now, you can just write a question that you wish to post on the poll and provide options for it. Instead of the default “Yes” and “No”, you can tap on these options and write any other choice.

#### 2\. Customize your Instagram Poll

As you can see, it is pretty easy to learn how to do a poll on Instagram. Once you have entered the text for the poll and the options, you can customize your story as well. For instance, you can tap on the top panel to get different backgrounds for your poll or can even post it on a picture.

From here, you can also swipe up to get different widgets that you can further add to your Instagram Story. You can insert music, countdown, location, mention someone, or even add interesting GIFs and stickers.

![Creative Instagram Poll](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/custom-instagram-poll.jpg)

Apart from that, you can write anything or even draw a pattern on your story to customize it the way you like.

#### 3\. Post your Instagram Poll

That’s it! Once you are satisfied with the editing of your Instagram Poll story, tap on the “Done” button from the top. Now, you can preview how your poll would look like and can tap on the “Send to” button. This will let you post your story for the entire audience or selective people.

## Creative Instagram Poll Questions and Ideas

By now, you would be able to understand how to do a poll on Instagram. Though, if you are running out of ideas to post, then here are some poll questions for Instagram that you can consider.

* _Asking about a location_

You can just post a picture of a place you have visited (like a famous monument or a city) and ask your audience if they have been to that place or not.

* _Instagram Poll Questions on Food_

Content related to food always performs well on Instagram. Therefore, you can post a photo of a dish that you have made and ask your audience whether they like it or not. You can even ask whether they would like you to share its recipe.

* _This or That_

You can find these poll questions for Instagram on almost every story these days. If you want, you can share a before and after look, pictures of two dresses, or anything else. Ask your audience which option they like the post.

* _Can you relate?_

These are some of the most interesting Instagram poll questions that you can post. Simply post a picture of a situation that you are in and ask your audience whether they can relate to it. You would be surprised to know how many other people can relate to the same situation.

* _Love or Hate_

This is similar to the “This or That” category, but the focus is on a single thing instead of two options. Just post a picture of a product and ask your audience whether they like it or not.

* _Rating on a Scale_

Apart from a simple yes/no poll, Instagram also lets us post a scale widget for a question. Your audience can just slide the scale (from zero to max) and let you know how much they like/dislike anything.

* _Do you agree?_

You can also see a lot of poll questions for Instagram in this pattern. Just post about something and ask your audience whether they agree to it or it. You can also ask them to DM you about their opinion if you want to engage with them.

## Explore More Ways to Use Instagram Polls

When it comes to the use of Instagram Polls, the sky is the limit. Since the feature lets us engage with our audience so easily, almost every brand is using it as a marketing tool these days. If you want, you can also implement some of these suggestions to make the most of Instagram Polls.

#### 1\. Get Instant Feedback

If you know how to do a poll on Instagram efficiently, then you can instantly get the feedback of your audience. For instance, if your brand is working on a new line of products and you are not sure about something, then why not post it on Instagram. In this way, you can know the feedback of its end-users and would help in the product’s development as well.

![Instant Instagram Poll Feedback](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/get-instant-ig-poll-feedback.jpg)

#### 2\. Be Creative

You might already know there are so many ways to do Instagram polls these days. Though, if you want your content to stand out, then try to be a bit creative. Instead of posting a simple yes/no poll, why not use emojis.

Let’s consider that you manage the Instagram profile of a beverage brand. Why not post a picture of a beach and ask your audience which beverage of yours they would enjoy the most. This would be quite an interesting post and will improve the engagement rate on your profile.

Now when you know how important Instagram polls can be, let’s quickly learn how to do a poll on Instagram. To post Instagram poll questions, you simply need an active Instagram account. You can post an Instagram poll for your entire audience to see, set selective audience, or even DM it to someone. To learn how to do a poll on Instagram, just follow these steps:

#### 1\. Create your Instagram Story

At first, you can simply launch Instagram on your phone and go to the Story feature from the top-left corner. Once the dedicated interface of Instagram Story is launched, go to the “Create” section from its home to come up with an Instagram poll.

On the Create panel, simply swipe up to get options to insert questions, polls, countdowns, and so on. From here, tap on the “Poll” option, and its widget would be added on the screen that you can easily move around to position.

#### 2\. Customize your Instagram Poll

As you can see, it is pretty easy to learn how to do a poll on Instagram. Once you have entered the text for the poll and the options, you can customize your story as well. For instance, you can tap on the top panel to get different backgrounds for your poll or can even post it on a picture.

From here, you can also swipe up to get different widgets that you can further add to your Instagram Story. You can insert music, countdown, location, mention someone, or even add interesting GIFs and stickers.

## Creative Instagram Poll Questions and Ideas

By now, you would be able to understand how to do a poll on Instagram. Though, if you are running out of ideas to post, then here are some poll questions for Instagram that you can consider.

* _Asking about a location_

You can just post a picture of a place you have visited (like a famous monument or a city) and ask your audience if they have been to that place or not.

* _Instagram Poll Questions on Food_

Content related to food always performs well on Instagram. Therefore, you can post a photo of a dish that you have made and ask your audience whether they like it or not. You can even ask whether they would like you to share its recipe.

* _This or That_

You can find these poll questions for Instagram on almost every story these days. If you want, you can share a before and after look, pictures of two dresses, or anything else. Ask your audience which option they like the post.

* _Can you relate?_

These are some of the most interesting Instagram poll questions that you can post. Simply post a picture of a situation that you are in and ask your audience whether they can relate to it. You would be surprised to know how many other people can relate to the same situation.

* _Love or Hate_

This is similar to the “This or That” category, but the focus is on a single thing instead of two options. Just post a picture of a product and ask your audience whether they like it or not.

* _Rating on a Scale_

Apart from a simple yes/no poll, Instagram also lets us post a scale widget for a question. Your audience can just slide the scale (from zero to max) and let you know how much they like/dislike anything.

* _Do you agree?_

You can also see a lot of poll questions for Instagram in this pattern. Just post about something and ask your audience whether they agree to it or it. You can also ask them to DM you about their opinion if you want to engage with them.

## Explore More Ways to Use Instagram Polls

When it comes to the use of Instagram Polls, the sky is the limit. Since the feature lets us engage with our audience so easily, almost every brand is using it as a marketing tool these days. If you want, you can also implement some of these suggestions to make the most of Instagram Polls.

#### 1\. Get Instant Feedback

If you know how to do a poll on Instagram efficiently, then you can instantly get the feedback of your audience. For instance, if your brand is working on a new line of products and you are not sure about something, then why not post it on Instagram.

#### 2\. Be Creative

You might already know there are so many ways to do Instagram polls these days. Though, if you want your content to stand out, then try to be a bit creative. Instead of posting a simple yes/no poll, why not use emojis.

Let’s consider that you manage the Instagram profile of a beverage brand. Why not post a picture of a beach and ask your audience which beverage of yours they would enjoy the most. This would be quite an interesting post and will improve the engagement rate on your profile.

#### 3\. Redirect your audience

Product placement is one of the major things that you should consider doing in Instagram Polls. Though, apart from simply posting your products, you can ask your audience their opinion about it. Besides that, you can also include your website’s link or a DM option on the story. This will help you redirect your audience to your product page and can increase its sales as well.

While Instagram Polls are undoubtedly one of the best ways to engage with your audience, there are plenty of other features that you can try. You can consider posting a question as well to directly interact with your audience.

Not just that, you can also use a slider widget with a poll (or even without it). Instead of just selecting yes or no, this will let your audience slide their choice to a preferred value and will further spike their interest.
