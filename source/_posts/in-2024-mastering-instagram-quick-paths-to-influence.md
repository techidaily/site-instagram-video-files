## Part 1: Instagram influencer definition

Before we start about working as an Instagram influencer, let’s understand what does [Instagram influencer mean](https://www.pixlee.com/definitions/definition-instagram-influencer)? Influencers are content creators on Instagram who also build communities across a particular niche or topic. Being a visually rich platform you always need the most visually dynamic content for better performance.

These content creators/influencers usually focus on photography, travel, beauty, fashion, food, fitness, lifestyle, or celebrities sharing their personal lives on Instagram. Their fan following ranges from 1000 to millions. Content creators with 1000 to 100,000 and beyond followers are known as micro-influencers.

Influencers with attractive photos and videos gain more followers, but those with genuine photos and honest information are much loved and appreciated by their followers.

## Part 2: How to become an Instagram influencer

If you think about how to become a famous Instagram influencer, then here are some quick tips to guide you through.

First of all, you need to select a niche you are extremely passionate about. It should be something that suits your personality and makes you feel connected. You need to have some basic knowledge of that and curiosity to delve deeper.

On social media, you can’t fake it if it’s not your passion, somewhere or the other your true persona will take over.

Rather than posting random things, figure out what can go in combo and curate your content. For example, you love fashion and good at DIY. Then you can show how to make DIY clothing, accessories, recycle things, etc. and retain your posts’ originality.
