While thinking of any Instagram captions most important thing is to be authentic. In any kind of content try to be real and put yourself out in front of viewers. Try to be human, you don’t sound like a robot. You may feel like being extra but being natural would make more sense.

#### Add some breaks to longer captions

Keeping short and on point, the Instagram caption is the best way of expressing yourself. But sometimes you feel like adding some extra elements and talk about a bit more too. Then you need to ensure that you are keeping some necessary breaks while writing a long caption just to make it look lighter to viewers. You don’t want to bore users by seeing at the length only right!

#### Include catchy emoji

Try inserting necessary emoji while writing your captions to create an appeal for your viewers. We all love emojis and adding them in an Instagram caption would make it look a little extra too.

#### Make use of the right hashtags

Keep in mind that you want your Instagram posts to gain maximum views and make them searchable too. One of the effective ways to do that is to use relevant hashtags depending upon your Instagram post. Try to be strategic with the hashtags and add the top-rated ones to engage with more people.
