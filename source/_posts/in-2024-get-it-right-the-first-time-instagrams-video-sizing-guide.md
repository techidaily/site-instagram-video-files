## Part 1 Types of Instagram video aspect ratios

The aspect ratio of the video varies with the places you choose to post on the Instagram platform. Here, clear illustrations on the aspect ratio are listed according to your needs.

Regular Posts: In the case of regular posts on the Instagram app, the expected aspect ratio is 1:1\. If you do not have square shape videos, then zoom out to landscape or portrait as per your requirements. Make the video sizes to either 1.91.1 (landscape) or 4:5 (Portrait). When you edit the aspect ratio, the resolution varies according to it respectively.
