**Conclusion:**

If you are a business on Instagram or a blogger, it would be advantageous to learn how to connect Instagram to Facebook. With so much competition today on digital platforms, posting consistent content for fast growth is wise. Rather than posting content on Facebook and Instagram separately, you can automatically post the same content on both platforms by connecting them. It helps in increasing visibility and saves time. We have explained how to connect Instagram to the Facebook account, Facebook page and unlink both social media for your ease. So, go ahead and start growing your brand.

### 3\. **Compare audience**

When both platforms are synced together, you can better analyze how the audience reacts to your posts. You can change your content to make it more engaging and valuable for your audience. The growth on both platforms is also almost the same, which benefits you.

### 4\. **Pay for ads in one place**

Facebook and Instagram ads are a few sources through which pages, bloggers, and brands gain an audience. Linking your accounts can make you run better ads that can help attract more audiences. Also, you can pay for ads on both platforms in a unified place.

**Conclusion:**

If you are a business on Instagram or a blogger, it would be advantageous to learn how to connect Instagram to Facebook. With so much competition today on digital platforms, posting consistent content for fast growth is wise. Rather than posting content on Facebook and Instagram separately, you can automatically post the same content on both platforms by connecting them. It helps in increasing visibility and saves time. We have explained how to connect Instagram to the Facebook account, Facebook page and unlink both social media for your ease. So, go ahead and start growing your brand.
