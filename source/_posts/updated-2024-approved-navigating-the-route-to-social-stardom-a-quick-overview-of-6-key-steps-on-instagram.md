## Part 1: What Does Official Instagram Say?

 Checking the [help files](https://help.instagram.com/398038890351915) can give you the clear picture of the verification process of Instagram account.

 The Instagram verified badge is the confirmation of the account being an authentic one. Whether a global brand, public figure or celebrity, a badge represents the genuineness of the account.

 As the celebs and brands are the most followed ones and people would always like to find them instantanuously, Instagram ensures the community faces no issues while searching the right account of their most followed brands or celebs.

 Instagram makes it very clear to the users that although Facebook owns Instagram, the two networking sites are not related to each other when it comes to followers or verifying the Instagram account.

 According to Instagram policies, if you have several followers or if one can find you easily doesn’t qualify you for the Instagram blue tick. Only the accounts that are being copied or have high chances of being imitated or impersonated are the ones with the verified badges.

## Part 3: How Do You Get A Blue Check On Instagram?

### 1\. Build Followers And Increase Engagement

 When you keep a check on your Instagram account, it helps to gain followers. Your account is at the top search results that build your account’s credibility. Whenever the question arises how to get verified on Instagram, several articles and write-ups inform that by building followers on the Instagram one can get easily verified.

 This is a wrong notion and not completely correct. On the contrary, if you have lesser followers and more clones to your account, Instagram consider it as high priority account for verification and the Instagram blue tick follows. Huge followers are not everything when it comes to verifying the Instagram account.

It is done to improve user experience and avert the imposters from creating fake accounts of public figures and misguide other users.

 An Instagram blue tick implies that Instagram knows your identity and helps in building the users’ trust that they are not following any fake account of a public figure.

### 5\. Choose Right Hashtags

 Choosing the perfect hashtags is one of the best ways to make yourself popular amongst your followers and other users. Instagram suggests many popular hastags or you may take help of hashtags suggesting apps for ideas.

 It is vital to use the right hashtag that fits your niche. Creating irrelevant content just to use a hashtag can never make you an influencer. So, creating hashtags for your personal brand and encouraging followers to use to more and more can prove to be beneficial.
