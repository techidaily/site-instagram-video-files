Creating Instagram Reels is as easy as making any other videos on Instagram, plus a few more editing perks. Just like you record stories, you can click on the Camera icon and slide to select Reels. Then, you'll be presented with multiple options to make your reels more engaging and unique.

Before your record your reels, you can select the speed to be super-fast or slow-mo. Plus, an audio library enables you to trim and add a favorite song part to your video. The Effects tab has trendy filters and special effects to make professional-looking videos with a single click. If you wish to record the 15-second reel in segments, you can click on the Align icon to record multiple clips seamlessly.

Instagram Reels can be from 3-15 seconds long. You can also use the Timer so that the reels stop recording automatically after the specified time limit. After recording, you can preview and then share it on your profile.

##### Final Words

Finally, now you know all there is to know about Instagram Reels. The secret of creating engaging Instagram Reels is out. And by using an Instagram Reels downloader, you can easily save your favorite videos to watch later. Also, after you save Instagram Reels locally to your phone, they can be shared on any platform like Facebook, Twitter, or even Whatsapp.

So, download Instagram Reels and watch them offline. Download as many reels as you like without any limit. The downloaded reels can also be edited and shared to make your profiles attractive.

Now, it's your turn to create or download an Instagram reel video and join in on the fun.

Good luck!
