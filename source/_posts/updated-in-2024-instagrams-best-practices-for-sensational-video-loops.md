## Part 4: How to Add Music & Sound to Loop Video for Instagram?

One downside of all these methods listed above is that it can only loop videos a specific amount of times. If you want to create looping video with more features, I recommend you to try [Wondershare's Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

Filmora allows you to create a looping video at the times you like, add music and sound effect to the looping video, and add titles as well.

Since we’re sharing looping videos to Instagram, let’s set up the project aspect ratio to 9:16 first and then import the video by clicking on the plus icon in the middle of the interface to add footage or photos.

 **Step 2:** Now, drag and drop the footage to the timeline, and then copy the video from the timeline by pressing Ctrl + C and then paste the video in the timeline as much time as you want to loop by pressing Ctrl + V.

 **Step 3:** To add music into the looping video, drag and drop the music file into the timeline and trim it according to the size of the video.

 **Step 4:** You can also add some elements, titles, or transitions to the looping video to make the looping much fun. At last, click Export and save it as MP4 or MOV format, share it with your Instagram or any desired social media platform.
