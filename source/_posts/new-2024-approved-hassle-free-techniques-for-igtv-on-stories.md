## Why Share Your IGTV Video on Your Story?

You might not know this, but the “Story” feature on Instagram is already used by over 500 million people and the app is still trying to push it. When you post a video on IGTV, chances are that it might get missed by your viewers. This is because the new Instagram algorithm only displays selective content in our feed.

On the other hand, all stories posted by the accounts that we follow will be displayed on the top banner of our Instagram home. Therefore, chances are that more people would see your story instead of a regular post. By sharing your IGTV video as your story, you can easily redirect your audience and let them know about the new content that you have posted.
