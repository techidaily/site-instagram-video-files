## How to Use Highlights and Story Links to Increase Conversions?

Generally, stories disappear after 24 hours if they are just posted to your profile. The ability to create highlights puts the stories into the profile until the highlight is deleted using the methods previously mentioned.

Instagram has over 200 million daily views making it the perfect platform for visual branding and sharing content.

Highlights which appear on your profile under your bio are the best way in which to share stories and otherwise archived content with your viewers.
