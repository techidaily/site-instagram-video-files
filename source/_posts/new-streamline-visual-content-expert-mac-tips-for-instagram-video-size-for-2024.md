## Conclusion

Hence, this was our complete guide on how to **resize videos for Instagram**, and now it's time to state our final words. Firstly, you have to ensure your video presence on the Instagram platform to increase your reach and engagement analytics. We've discussed a step-by-step guide on quickly resizing videos for Instagram via Wondershare Filmora's new update for the Mac version.

As mentioned earlier, their newly launched Auto Reframe feature is what we've tried to stress upon in the guide. The very first reason that we selected the particular software is its ease of use. Then, the automatic resizing of videos for different social media channels is quite remarkable. In this digital age, it's usual that you have to switch among various social media platforms instantly. Thus, you can solve the difficulty of fitting a single video as per aspect ratios of these platforms via auto-reframing tools.

So, choose the best and effective!
