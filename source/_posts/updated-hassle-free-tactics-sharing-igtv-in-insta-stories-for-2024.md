## Why Share Your IGTV Video on Your Story?

You might not know this, but the “Story” feature on Instagram is already used by over 500 million people and the app is still trying to push it. When you post a video on IGTV, chances are that it might get missed by your viewers. This is because the new Instagram algorithm only displays selective content in our feed.

On the other hand, all stories posted by the accounts that we follow will be displayed on the top banner of our Instagram home. Therefore, chances are that more people would see your story instead of a regular post. By sharing your IGTV video as your story, you can easily redirect your audience and let them know about the new content that you have posted.

## Why Share Your IGTV Video on Your Story?

You might not know this, but the “Story” feature on Instagram is already used by over 500 million people and the app is still trying to push it. When you post a video on IGTV, chances are that it might get missed by your viewers. This is because the new Instagram algorithm only displays selective content in our feed.

On the other hand, all stories posted by the accounts that we follow will be displayed on the top banner of our Instagram home. Therefore, chances are that more people would see your story instead of a regular post. By sharing your IGTV video as your story, you can easily redirect your audience and let them know about the new content that you have posted.

## A Step-by-step Guide for Sharing an IGTV Video on Instagram Story

One of the best things about Instagram is that you can share almost anything on your story. If you want, you can easily share your own post or IGTV video. Besides that, if you wish to promote your friends, then you can share their IGTV video on your story as well. You can even customize it with the inbuilt markups available in the Story interface. To learn how to share IGTV video on the Instagram story, just follow these steps.

#### 1. Select the IGTV Video to Share

To start with, you have to select what you wish to share on your Instagram story. You can visit yours or anyone else’s profile and tap on the IGTV icon. By default, it is the second icon (between your photo grid and photos of you).

![ Select IGTV Video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/select-igtv-video.jpg)

This will display various IGTV videos that are posted by that account. You can tap on any video thumbnail and the content would be loaded. Once the IGTV video would start playing, you can tap on the share icon from the bottom of the screen. This is depicted by a tilted arrow icon right next to the like and comment options.

As you will tap on the share icon, you will get options to send the video to your friends or post it as your story. From the provided options, just tap on the “Add video to your story” button to continue.

This will automatically load the Instagram Story interface with the selected video. You can easily shrink or expand the video on the screen to make sure it has the right fit. Besides that, you can also use the inbuilt features of the Story to add comments, texts, stickers, and so on.

![ Share to IG Story](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/share-to-ig-story.jpg)

This will let you share your story with selected friends, the group of close friends, or all followers. If you wish to share it with everyone, then just tap on the “Share” button adjacent to the “Your Story” option.
