## A Step-by-step Guide for Adding Music to IG Story

To make it easier for us to post interesting stories, Instagram has come up with the Music feature. Using it, we can look for tons of popular songs in different languages and add our favorite snippets to our story. Presently, the feature of Instagram Music is available for English, German, French, Hindi, and a few other local languages. Also, you can post a snippet of at most 15 seconds since that is the maximum duration of an Instagram story. To learn how to add music to the IG story, you can follow these simple steps right away:

#### 1. Select the Music feature for IG story

To start with, just launch the Instagram application on your phone and tap on the “Add Story” button. You can find it on the top-left corner of the screen, depicted by a “+” sign with your profile picture.

![ Add Story Button](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-story.jpg)
