### #10\. Can Instagram Reels replace TikTok?

Instagram Reels has been successful, but the big question is that can it replace TikTok?

Currently, TikTok is relatively better as it provides more options and space to grow as compared to the Reels. However, we are sure that Facebook will not give up so quickly and continue to update Instagram.
