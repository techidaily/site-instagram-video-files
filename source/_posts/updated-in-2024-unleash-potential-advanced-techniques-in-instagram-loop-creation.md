Boomerang is a video app which allows you to record looping videos like animated gif. In the following part, I will show you 2 different ways to making looping video with Boomerang.

* Record the video using the in-app camera of the Boomerang app since there is only one button which can create moving looping clip instantly.
* Now you can share the video to either Instagram or Facebook directly, or you can save it to your camera roll, and then upload it on social media.

## Part 3: How to Upload Looping Live Photos as Videos on iPhone to Instagram?

If you are using iPhone, you may find that when you took Live Photos, there was a Loop effect under it. In this part, I will show you how to upload the looping live photos to Instagram.

 **Step 1: Add Bounce or Loop Effect to Live Photos**

Go to Photos app on iPhone and open the live photo. Swipe up and you will four options: live, loop, and bounce, and long exposure.

 **Step 2: Save Looping Live Photo into A Video**

If you sharing the live photo applied Loop or Bounce effect to social media directly, you will find the animation is lost. So, before sharing, we need to save the looping live photo to video first.
