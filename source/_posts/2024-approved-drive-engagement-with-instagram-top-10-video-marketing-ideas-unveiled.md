## Part 1: You Need To Understand IG First

If you market a product without knowing the culture, tastes, or likes of the people around, you are most likely to fail. So, while marketing a product on Instagram, you must know and understand the culture followed at Instagram.

It is quite possible that your Instagram video marketing content is for introducing a new product. The product can be in a number of colors or have a lot of features. But, that doesn’t mean you have to include it all in a 60-second video. Only add a few features and make the objective of the video clear for the audience to feel connected.

You may also create several short videos to make the audience understand it easily instead of one long video.
