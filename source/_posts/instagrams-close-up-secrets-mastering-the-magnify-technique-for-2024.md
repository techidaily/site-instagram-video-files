There are two-options while you want to zoom in/out using the 'Hands-Free' mode. You can pinch the screen and zoom in or out prior to recording the video. Now, tap the record button, the video will be automatically recorded after a few seconds. Remember! You are using the 'Hands-Free' mode, so no holding the record button. The second method is similar to the previous methods of zooming in/out videos for Instagram Stories. Tap the record button and wait till the point where you want to zoom in/out. At that very point, hold the record button and slide your finger up/down to zoom in/out the video. This is how to zoom in/out Instagram Stories using 'Hands-Free' mode.

Be it a 'Boomerang', 'Rewind', 'Hands-Free', or 'Normal' mode video, learning how to zoom in Instagram Stories is sure to make your stories cool and funky.
