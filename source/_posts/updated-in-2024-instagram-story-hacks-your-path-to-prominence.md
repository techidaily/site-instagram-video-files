### Add link

Adding links to your Instagram Stories is one of the trendiest things now. Gone are the days of 'link in bio' under your description.

This is an interesting way of driving traffic to your business page, or your YouTube channel, and the likes.

First add a video or picture and then click on the paperclip icon from the top right corner of the screen. Enter your URL after tapping the paperclip icon, and then share it as your Instagram Story to lure your audience. The 'Swipe Up' message will be displayed at the bottom of the story. You can drive your audience towards it by being little creative and drawing an arrow pointing to this text.

### Add music

If adding 'Stickers', 'Text', and choosing filters aren't enough for your perfect Insta Story video, why don't you try adding your favorite music to it? First of all play an audio using the inbuilt player in your phone (you can stream online as well) and then move to Instagram and tap the camera icon to shoot the video. When your recording is complete, you can share this video along with your favorite track as your Instagram Story. Take care that the music icon is not muted ('X' mark over it).
