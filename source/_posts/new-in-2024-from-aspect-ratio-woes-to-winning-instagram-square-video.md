We have had a dramatic technological change over the past two decades. Mobile phones come with unique features that make life easier and more enjoyable.

Various software and applications have been developed and can be used to find solutions in many ways and in many industries.

With the advent of social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, and TikTok, video creation has become increasingly important in many products and organizations.

Many business owners have found that there is a great deal of value in making engaging video content that can be costly and quality.

Many industries specialize in creating mind-boggling video content. But what happens when a beginner wishes to create something of the same effect, quality and attractiveness? A variety of applications can help beginners create great content without the need for office space or high-end devices. This little secret is iMovie.

**iMovie Square Video**

One software that works well within the digital space is a video editing application known as iMovie. It is a video editing software supported for macOS, iOS, and iPad OS devices.

This app was developed in the late 20th century in 1999 and features an easy-to-use interface with a timeline, a preview window, and a media browser.

Many experts consider iMovie to be a contemporary non-linear editor. With little or no technical experience, videos can be cut or edited without changing the original format of the file using its many features.

With the high cost of some editing apps, Movie seems to be a good choice for beginners. The Movie is accurate, just like any other Apple product. This software was created with the idea that not everyone is a great editor or expert.

iMovie is easy to use and with a bit of practice. A newbie can extract quality content and product engagement or personal use.

**Why Square Videos?**

It may surprise us, but square videos have recently received a lot of attention, and the reason for this is not forgotten.

One important reason for this popularity is that social media platforms such as Facebook, TikTok, and Instagram are the ideal square video games.

Square videos take up a lot of screen space, especially in viewer feeds, rather than landscape video. The more your screen takes the user's screen, the better. It may interest you to know that the screen-filling videos are very attractive.

There are various benefits to using the iMovie app. As mentioned earlier, the app has features for adjusting and enlarging video color settings, cropping and rotating video clips, stabilizing unstable videos, and increasing video transitions (such as blurring and speed changes). Video clip effects include cropping, using a green/blue screen to extract a title, replacing the background with a different clip, screen splitting, and making a photo-picture effect.

By removing background sound and raising audio levels for silent clips, iMovie can also help to convert and enhance video audio.

Movie trailers can be created using templates provided in iMovie. The trailer tool in iMovie makes it easy to drop clips on a timeline, separated by a panel board with labels indicating what type of clip should be placed in each window.

A guide to adding titles and credits to the cart is also included in the template. There is no doubt that using iMovie can get a beginner a unique video spark. It can get the industry any updates needed. Developers can use app previews to give users a quick overview of the app using video rather than graphics.

Let's look at how to generate square movies for Instagram with iMovie now.

## Part 1\. How to Make a Square Video for Instagram in iMovie on iPhone?

## Part 2\. How to Make a Square Video in iMovie on Mac?

**Step #5\.** Drag one of your video's corners out to make it fit the square proportions appropriately.

 Aug 18, 2022â€¢ Proven solutions

We have had a dramatic technological change over the past two decades. Mobile phones come with unique features that make life easier and more enjoyable.

Various software and applications have been developed and can be used to find solutions in many ways and in many industries.

With the advent of social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, and TikTok, video creation has become increasingly important in many products and organizations.

Many business owners have found that there is a great deal of value in making engaging video content that can be costly and quality.

Many industries specialize in creating mind-boggling video content. But what happens when a beginner wishes to create something of the same effect, quality and attractiveness? A variety of applications can help beginners create great content without the need for office space or high-end devices. This little secret is iMovie.

**iMovie Square Video**

One software that works well within the digital space is a video editing application known as iMovie. It is a video editing software supported for macOS, iOS, and iPad OS devices.

This app was developed in the late 20th century in 1999 and features an easy-to-use interface with a timeline, a preview window, and a media browser.

Many experts consider iMovie to be a contemporary non-linear editor. With little or no technical experience, videos can be cut or edited without changing the original format of the file using its many features.

With the high cost of some editing apps, Movie seems to be a good choice for beginners. The Movie is accurate, just like any other Apple product. This software was created with the idea that not everyone is a great editor or expert.

iMovie is easy to use and with a bit of practice. A newbie can extract quality content and product engagement or personal use.

**Why Square Videos?**

It may surprise us, but square videos have recently received a lot of attention, and the reason for this is not forgotten.

One important reason for this popularity is that social media platforms such as Facebook, TikTok, and Instagram are the ideal square video games.

Square videos take up a lot of screen space, especially in viewer feeds, rather than landscape video. The more your screen takes the user's screen, the better. It may interest you to know that the screen-filling videos are very attractive.

There are various benefits to using the iMovie app. As mentioned earlier, the app has features for adjusting and enlarging video color settings, cropping and rotating video clips, stabilizing unstable videos, and increasing video transitions (such as blurring and speed changes). Video clip effects include cropping, using a green/blue screen to extract a title, replacing the background with a different clip, screen splitting, and making a photo-picture effect.

By removing background sound and raising audio levels for silent clips, iMovie can also help to convert and enhance video audio.

Movie trailers can be created using templates provided in iMovie. The trailer tool in iMovie makes it easy to drop clips on a timeline, separated by a panel board with labels indicating what type of clip should be placed in each window.

A guide to adding titles and credits to the cart is also included in the template. There is no doubt that using iMovie can get a beginner a unique video spark. It can get the industry any updates needed. Developers can use app previews to give users a quick overview of the app using video rather than graphics.

Let's look at how to generate square movies for Instagram with iMovie now.

## Part 1\. How to Make a Square Video for Instagram in iMovie on iPhone?

Videos are a fantastic way to keep memories alive, but some social media platforms - specifically, Instagram - demand videos to be a certain size and length before they can be uploaded. Fortunately, cropping your video before sharing it is a straightforward process. Here are some pointers to help you crop a movie and modify the screen size to whatever you want. Cropping your films is useful for a variety of reasons. Perhaps you'd like to focus on a specific component of the film or get rid of your thumb from the screen's corner. You'll need iMovie, which comes preloaded on most iPhones, to crop a video on your iPhone. If your phone does not already have iMovie, you may get it for free from the App Store. The size or aspect ratio of your video will not change if you use this method. It will just zoom in on your video and possibly crop out any unwanted things.

To use the crop/zoom feature in iMovie on iPhone, follow these steps:

**Step #1.** On your iPhone, open the iMovie app.

**Step #2\.** Navigate to **Projects**.

**Step #3\.** The enormous + sign should be tapped. Choose a movie.

**Step #4\.** Go to the video you want to crop and select it, then press **Create Movie** at the bottom of the screen.

**Step #5\.** Three portions will appear on your screen. In the lower left-hand corner of the screen, tap the timeline section.

**Step #6\.** In the upper right-hand corner of the screen, tap the small magnifying glass.

**Step #7\.** You may now zoom in and out of your movie with your thumb and forefinger.

**Step #8\.** Press the play button to see a preview of the video.

**Step #9\.** Tap **Done** in the top left corner when you're satisfied with the results.

**Step #10\.** To save your movie to your Camera Roll, tap the square with an arrow icon.
