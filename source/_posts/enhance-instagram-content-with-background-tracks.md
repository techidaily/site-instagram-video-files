### Adding Music to Instagram Stories

The ephemeral content is rising in popularity every day, which is the reason why Instagram Stories are rapidly becoming an integral part of our daily routines. As most of you already know, these videos must be recorded with the Instagram app, and for that reason, you can't really use any of the video or sound editing apps you would normally use to add music to the videos you post on this photo and video sharing platform.

Using apps like Spotify to play music while recording your Instagram stories is currently the only way to add music to an Instagram story video. You should launch the Spotify app or any other app you choose, and then launch the Instagram app. If you would like to use a particular part of a song, simply pause the song at that section.

In order to start recording an Instagram story, you'll need to tap on the camera icon that is located in the upper left corner of the app's screen. Use the Control Center to switch to the app from which you want to play music from and hit play. Head back to the Instagram app and start recording your story while the music is playing. The 15-second video will be added to your Story after you click on the + icon.

### Adding Music to Instagram Stories

The ephemeral content is rising in popularity every day, which is the reason why Instagram Stories are rapidly becoming an integral part of our daily routines. As most of you already know, these videos must be recorded with the Instagram app, and for that reason, you can't really use any of the video or sound editing apps you would normally use to add music to the videos you post on this photo and video sharing platform.

Using apps like Spotify to play music while recording your Instagram stories is currently the only way to add music to an Instagram story video. You should launch the Spotify app or any other app you choose, and then launch the Instagram app. If you would like to use a particular part of a song, simply pause the song at that section.

In order to start recording an Instagram story, you'll need to tap on the camera icon that is located in the upper left corner of the app's screen. Use the Control Center to switch to the app from which you want to play music from and hit play. Head back to the Instagram app and start recording your story while the music is playing. The 15-second video will be added to your Story after you click on the + icon.

### Conclusion

Adding music to your Instagram stories and videos will make them more dynamic and fun to watch.
