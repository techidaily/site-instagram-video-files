## Bonus: Tips for making better Instagram Highlight cover

Instagram highlight covers design should be such that it immediately grabs the attention of your audience. Since it forms a part of your brand aesthetics, the color and design elements you use should be consistent.

Here are a few tips to make better Instagram highlight covers.

**Tip #1 – Have the Same Style**

When creating Insta highlight covers with either a photo, icons, typography, or illustrations, keep the same style across all covers. A compilation of different styles makes your highlight covers disorganized and difficult to follow.

**Tip #2 – Be Precise**

Highlight covers have a small viewing window. Make sure the design is easy to read and clear. Simple designs are perfect for highlight covers as they are easy to see for your audience.

**Tip #3 – Incorporate Your Brand Assets**

Instagram highlight covers are an extension of your brand. Incorporating your brand's assets is an excellent way to make your highlights feel more professional. You can include your brand voice and style. Or go with the colors, fonts, or design trademarks that you use on other channels.

**Conclusion**

Creating Instagram Highlight Covers is a quick and easy way to maintain your brand aesthetic and get more views. Putting in some time and effort into creating beautiful, high-quality highlight covers benefits you in many ways. It helps increase brand awareness, showcase your most valuable Instagram Stories content, and attract new followers.
