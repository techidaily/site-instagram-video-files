**Step 1:** Launch Hyperlapse on your iPhone, press the **record** button. Stop filming anytime you wish and keep your hands motionless.

**Step 2:** You'll see a speedometer now. The default speed is **6X**, but you may lower it to **1X** or boost it to **12X** if you choose. Move to the right to speed up the video.
