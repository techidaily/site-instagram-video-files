You no longer have to be a trained professional to capture videos, all you need is a Smartphone, a GoPro or a DSLR camera.

However, the web version of Instagram that allows you to upload photos and videos doesn't exist, but luckily there are platforms that can help you post photos and videos to Instagram directly from your desktop.
